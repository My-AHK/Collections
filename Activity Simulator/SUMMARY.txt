
*  Simulates random keys, modifiers, and mouse nudges.


PURPOSE:
This script is designed to simulate random keyboard activity, occasional modifier key presses, and intermittent mouse "nudges" to prevent system idleness or emulate natural user interaction. 
The simulation runs in the background, optionally showing real-time ToolTips of each simulated action and logging events to an INI file for activity tracking. 
The toggleable nature of the script allows users to activate or deactivate all features with a single hotkey, ensuring flexible control.
   • Prevents system idle state by simulating human-like input.
   • Useful for testing, demonstration, or preventing screen lock.
   • Tracks activity through optional logging.

KEY FEATURES:
The script includes multiple coordinated systems for simulating activity while allowing detailed control over visibility, randomness, and persistence of logs. 
Each subsystem, random key pressing, idle nudging, and modifier key usage, can run independently but is toggled simultaneously for simplicity.
   • Random key press simulation with realistic timing intervals.
   • Occasional modifier key presses for varied activity.
   • Idle nudge mouse movement to mimic human presence.
   • Optional ToolTips displaying ongoing simulated actions.
   • Configurable log file for recording all actions.
   • Hotkey toggle (Ctrl+T) for instant activation/deactivation.
   • Adjustable key, modifier, and nudge delay ranges.
   • Automatic cleanup of timers and logs upon exit.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The core logic uses timers that trigger specific functions at random intervals, making activity patterns appear natural. 
Each system has a low and high delay range from which a random interval is selected. 
The random key press function decides between normal keys and shifted punctuation, while the modifier function randomly selects from available modifier keys. 
The idle nudge moves the mouse slightly after a random pause. 
All actions can be logged with timestamps, and ToolTips are optionally displayed based on settings. 
The hotkey not only toggles all systems but also plays a sound and updates the status display.
   • On hotkey press, toggle booleans for each system and set/clear timers accordingly.
   • Key press routine randomly chooses between normal or shifted keys.
       ⮞ Sends Shift down/up as needed for punctuation.
   • Modifier routine picks one modifier at random and simulates a quick press.
   • Idle nudge waits a random time before moving the mouse cursor slightly.
   • Logging functions store counts and timestamps in an INI file.
   • Cleanup function stops timers and deletes logs (if not preserved).

LAYOUT:
The script is structured with clear separation between initialization, hotkey handling, core simulation functions, supporting functions, and cleanup. 
Settings for offsets, key definitions, and timing are centralized at the start for easy customization. 
ToolTip offset variables define where visual feedback appears relative to the cursor, and activity logging settings control file creation and deletion behavior.
   • Initialization: Environment settings, GUI creation, and variable declarations.
   • Hotkey Handler: Central toggle for enabling/disabling all features.
   • Core Functions: Timed routines for keys, modifiers, and mouse nudges.
   • Support Functions: Random selection logic, logging, ToolTip handling.
   • Cleanup: Ensures no residual timers or files remain after exit.

USER EXPERIENCE:
From a user’s perspective, this script provides a seamless background simulation that can be entirely invisible if ToolTips are disabled. 
The hotkey offers quick control, and the beep feedback confirms changes without requiring visual confirmation. 
For those who prefer tracking, logs provide detailed timestamps and counts of every action taken. 
The randomization in timing and action type ensures that simulated activity mimics natural human interaction, reducing the predictability often associated with automation.
   • Simple one-hotkey control for all features.
   • Optional real-time ToolTips for transparency.
   • Audible toggle confirmation via different-pitch beeps.
   • Adjustable parameters for personalization.
   • Logs available for auditing or performance review.

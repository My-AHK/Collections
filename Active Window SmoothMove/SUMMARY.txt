
*  Smooth, animated window repositioning.

═══════════════════════════════════════
PURPOSE:
═══════════════════════════════════════
This script enables smooth, animated movement of a selected window to a new position on the screen. 
Instead of instantly jumping to coordinates, the active window glides across the screen in visually progressive steps, creating a natural motion effect ideal for transitions or visual emphasis.
   • Triggered with Ctrl + F1 to move the active window.
   • Smoothly transitions the window from current to target position (300,100).
   • Adjustable smoothness and speed through defined steps and delay.

KEY FEATURES:
═══════════════════════════════════════
The script focuses on user-defined motion behavior and flexibility while maintaining simplicity and performance. 
It employs incremental window repositioning for an animated experience.
   • Customizable Parameters  
       ⮞ `steps` defines the number of movement increments, controlling smoothness.  
       ⮞ `delay` defines the pause between each incremental move.  
   • Keyboard Shortcut  
       ⮞ `Ctrl + F1` instantly starts a smooth move for the currently active window.  
   • Direct Window Targeting  
       ⮞ Uses `"A"` for active window selection to avoid window title dependency.  
   • Performance Optimized  
       ⮞ `SetBatchLines -1` and `SetWinDelay 0` ensure uninterrupted motion.  
   • Reusable Function  
       ⮞ `SmoothMove()` can be applied to any window by adjusting arguments.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
═══════════════════════════════════════
At its core, the logic calculates the difference between the current and target window positions, divides it into equal increments, and moves the window step-by-step using a timed loop.
   • The function retrieves the active window’s current position.  
   • Mathematical deltas (`deltaX` and `deltaY`) determine per-step motion.  
   • A loop iterates through each step, incrementally moving the window.  
   • Each iteration includes a controlled delay to regulate animation speed.  
   • Once the loop completes, the window arrives precisely at the destination.
       ⮞ Example: A move from (0,0) → (300,100) with 25 steps and 10ms delay results in smooth movement lasting roughly 250ms total.  
       ⮞ Users can fine-tune both values for faster or slower motion effects.

LAYOUT:
═══════════════════════════════════════
The script is concise and logically separated into a hotkey trigger and a dedicated function block. 
Documentation is provided inline for clarity.
   • Header: Initialization directives for optimal runtime efficiency.  
   • Hotkey: Ctrl + F1 defined as the motion trigger.  
   • Function: `SmoothMove()` encapsulates reusable motion logic.  
   • Footer: Final Return for script closure consistency.

USER EXPERIENCE:
═══════════════════════════════════════
The user experiences visually fluid window movement with minimal effort. 
The animation effect adds polish to workspace interactions while remaining practical and responsive.
   • Smoothness gives an aesthetic appeal during repositioning.  
   • Adjustable motion parameters enable personalized experience.  
   • Non-intrusive hotkey allows use during multitasking.  
   • Simple code structure makes future modifications straightforward.

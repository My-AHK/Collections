
*  Persistent-position always-on-top GUI window.


PURPOSE:
This script creates a compact, always-on-top GUI window and displays it at a saved screen position or centered by default. It allows persistent placement by reading from an external `.ini` file to restore the window's last known position when launched.

KEY FEATURES:
The main feature is position persistence via an `.ini` file, which stores the GUI's previous location on screen. This approach provides a consistent user experience without requiring the user to reposition the window every time it opens.
   • Restores window position using `IniRead`.
   • Uses `+Hwnd` to retrieve the window ID for possible future manipulation.
   • Window stays on top and uses a minimal tool window style.
   • Colored background for quick visibility (`8000FF`).
   • Window size and location are explicitly defined upon showing.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
Upon activation with `Ctrl+T`, the script first reads the last saved position from a config file. If no prior data exists, the window is centered. It then creates the GUI with specific attributes and displays it at the determined location.
   • `IniRead` pulls the position string from "ClosePosition.ini".
   • `+Hwndgui_id` stores the GUI’s window handle.
   • GUI options `+AlwaysOnTop` and `+ToolWindow` define its behavior and style.
   • The `Show` command applies the saved or default positioning.

LAYOUT:
The GUI is a small, plain box sized at 250x100 pixels, displayed either at a user-defined position or the center of the screen. Its design is deliberately minimal for lightweight use.
   • Fixed dimensions: width 250, height 100.
   • Solid background color: bright purple (`8000FF`).
   • No additional controls or elements.

USER EXPERIENCE:
The script simplifies repeated use by maintaining window position between sessions, reducing user effort. Its always-on-top feature ensures visibility, while the minimal layout keeps distractions low.
   • Automatically remembers where the user last placed the window.
   • No need for title bar interaction thanks to auto-positioning.
   • Visual contrast ensures the window is easily noticed.

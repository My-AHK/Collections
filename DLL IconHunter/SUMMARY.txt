
*  Scans System32 DLLs for embedded icons.


PURPOSE:
This script scans the System32 directory for DLL files and identifies those that contain embedded icon resources. The results are compiled into a formatted text report, listing each DLL with its respective icon count and summarizing key statistics at the end.

KEY FEATURES:
It performs a comprehensive two-pass scan to first determine formatting alignment and then extract icon counts. Results are alphabetized and stored in a structured text file with a timestamp and privilege-level note.
   • Identifies DLLs that contain icons using safe enumeration methods.
   • Displays progress visually during scanning.
   • Automatically opens the report upon completion.
   • Ensures output is aligned and formatted with consistent column widths.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script first calculates the longest filename for alignment purposes. It then loops through all `.dll` files in `System32`, loading each safely to count icons using system resource enumeration. Only DLLs containing icons are included in the final list.
   • Counts icons using both RT_GROUP_ICON and RT_ICON types for accuracy.
   • Uses two custom callback functions to safely tally resources.
   • Appends file-specific data and a summary block to the output file.

LAYOUT:
The output file begins with a header block noting generation time, user privilege, and column headers. DLL filenames are followed by padded spacing and their respective icon count, aligned for readability.
   • Header includes timestamp and user type.
   • Each line shows: filename (padded) + icon count.
   • A final summary line reports total DLLs scanned and icons found.

USER EXPERIENCE:
Users initiate the scan by pressing `F1`, triggering an automatic progress bar and background processing. Once completed, a neatly formatted text file is opened for review.
   • No input is required after launch.
   • Text output is immediately readable and informative.
   • Report structure is consistent and ready for archival or review.

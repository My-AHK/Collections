
Summary of All Three Scripts

The three scripts in question—Primary, Secondary, and Dual—are designed to handle window positioning based on different monitor setups, ensuring flexibility and maintainability when positioning GUIs on either single or multi-monitor systems.

Primary Monitor Script: The Primary Monitor script positions a GUI window based on hotkeys triggered by either alphanumeric or Numpad keys. The window is placed at different positions using a system of Cartesian coordinates: Left (L), Horizontal-Center (HC), Right (R), Up (U), Vertical-Center (VC), and Down (D). This script offers precise control over the GUI's position on the primary monitor, with each hotkey moving the window to a predefined location. It is built for simplicity, as it uses the coordinates of the primary monitor (MonLeft, MonTop, MonRight, MonBottom) to position the window. The window is also always kept on top of other windows and can be moved around using the hotkey assignments, ensuring the GUI’s visibility and ease of use during testing.

Secondary Monitor Script: The Secondary Monitor script is a more specialized version of the Primary script. It provides similar functionality, but with the added complexity of positioning the window on a secondary monitor in a multi-monitor setup. The script ensures that the window is displayed at specific coordinates on the secondary monitor (Mon2Left, Mon2Top, Mon2Right, Mon2Bottom). This version of the script incorporates detection of the second monitor's boundaries and calculates the position of the window relative to the second screen. By using hotkeys, the user can move the window around the secondary monitor’s space, ensuring compatibility with both primary and secondary monitor configurations. The system accounts for both the main screen and the secondary monitor, ensuring seamless use in a multi-display environment.

Dual Monitor Script: The Dual Monitor script combines the functionality of both the Primary and Secondary scripts. It is designed to be used in setups with two monitors, positioning the window in relation to both screens. This script extends the behavior of the other two, taking into account the layout and resolution of both monitors. With this script, users can use the same hotkeys to control the window's position across both monitors, with more sophisticated handling of coordinates that factors in both screen resolutions and placements. It allows for efficient window placement without having to manually adjust the GUI’s position, making it easier to work in a dual-monitor configuration. The window's placement is calculated based on the boundaries of both monitors, and the GUI can be moved between the two displays with ease.

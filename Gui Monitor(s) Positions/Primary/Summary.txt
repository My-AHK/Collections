
Designed to create a minimalistic, movable GUI that can be positioned on the screen using predefined hotkeys. It utilizes the Cartesian coordinate system for maintainability and clarity when defining positions. Below are the key details:

GUI Layout:

The GUI is always on top, has no caption, and features a border for visibility.
Default dimensions are 200x150 pixels with a red background and centered yellow and black text for instructions.
Positioning System:

Uses shorthand position indicators:
Horizontal: L (Left), HC (Horizontal Center), R (Right).
Vertical: U (Up), VC (Vertical Center), D (Down).
Default position is at the bottom center of the primary monitor (D HC).
Hotkey Functionality:

Hotkeys are defined for cycling through GUI positions.
Supports both alphanumeric keys (1-9) and corresponding numpad keys.
Each hotkey adjusts the GUI position as follows:
1: Bottom-left (D L).
2: Bottom-center (D HC).
3: Bottom-right (D R).
4: Center-left (VC L).
5: Center (VC HC).
6: Center-right (VC R).
7: Top-left (U L).
8: Top-center (U HC).
9: Top-right (U R).
Positioning Logic:

A WinMove function calculates the GUI's position based on monitor work area dimensions:
Retrieves the monitor's boundaries via SysGet.
Computes coordinates based on the position string.
Moves the GUI to the calculated location.
Custom Function:

The WinMove function replaces shorthand notations (e.g., b with d) and handles calculations for GUI placement using current screen dimensions and desired alignment.

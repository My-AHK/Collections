
Designed to create a minimalistic, movable GUI that can be positioned on the PRIMARY screen using predefined hotkeys. 
It utilizes the Cartesian coordinate system for maintainability and clarity when defining positions. 
Below are the key details:

1. GUI Layout:
   • The GUI is always on top, has no caption, and features a border for visibility.
   • Default dimensions are 200x150 pixels with a red background and centered yellow and black text for instructions.

2.Positioning System:
   • Uses shorthand position indicators:
      - Horizontal: L (Left), HC (Horizontal Center), R (Right).
      - Vertical: U (Up), VC (Vertical Center), D (Down).
   • Default position is at the bottom center of the primary monitor (D HC).

3.Hotkey Functionality:
   • Hotkeys are defined for cycling through GUI positions.
   • Supports both alphanumeric keys (1-9) and corresponding numpad keys.

4. Positioning Logic:
   • A WinMove function calculates the GUI's position based on monitor work area dimensions:
      - Retrieves the monitor's boundaries via SysGet.
      - Computes coordinates based on the position string.
      - Moves the GUI to the calculated location.

5. Custom Function:
   • The WinMove function replaces shorthand notations (e.g., b with d) and handles calculations for GUI placement using current screen dimensions and desired alignment.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Choose your password and generate its MD5 hash using 'MD5 Hash Creator.ahk'.
2. Replace storedPasswordHash with your actual MD5 hash in 'FolderGuard.ahk'.
3. Change protectedFolder to your desired folder path.
4. Save the script and run it.

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
 • This provides basic protection - not military-grade security.
 • Tech-savvy users can still access hidden folders.
 • The password hash is stored in plain text in the script.
 • For real security, use proper encryption tools like VeraCrypt or BitLocker.


========================================================


 THE SHARE: "The MD5 Function"
At the bottom of both scripts, you'll see the same block of code called MD5(). This is the "engine" that does the actual work of converting text into a hash.
  • In Script 1, it's used to create the hash you see and copy.
  • In Script 2, it's used to turn the password you type in (e.g., "cookie123") into a hash, so it can check if it matches the stored hash (e.g., "bc2ab4d7c238297dcef22007254ac5e0"). The script never knows or stores your actual password, which is a safe way to do it!

In a Nutshell
  • Use Script 1 when you just need to quickly make an MD5 hash of some text.
  • Use Script 2 when you want a simple way to hide a folder on your PC and make it reappear with a password.

--------------------------------------

** Script 1 is a "Text-to-MD5 Converter"
  - What it does:
This is a simple tool that takes any word or sentence you type and turns it into a special code called an "MD5 Hash." This code is a jumbled-up version of your text that is always the same length.

  - Why you might use it:
  • To create a password for a website without sending your actual password.
  • To quickly generate a unique code for a file or piece of data.
  • Just to see what the MD5 hash of a word looks like.

  - How it works, step-by-step:
  1. You run the script.
  2. A small box pops up asking you to "Please Enter String to convert to MD5 hash."
  3. You type something, like hello, and click OK.
  4. The script works its magic in the background, converting hello into its MD5 hash: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592.
  5. A message box shows you both your original text and the new hash.
  6. Most importantly, it automatically copies the hash to your computer's clipboard, so you can just press Ctrl+V to paste it anywhere you need it.

** Script 2 is a "Simple Folder Locker"
  - What it does:
This script lets you "lock" and "unlock" a specific folder on your computer using a password. "Locking" makes the folder invisible in File Explorer. "Unlocking" makes it visible again.

  - Important Note: This is a basic "hide-and-seek" lock, not a military-grade encryption. It's perfect for keeping things out of casual view (like from siblings or coworkers), but a tech-savvy person could find it. It's for privacy, not top-secret security.

  - Before you use it, you need to set it up:
  • Tell it which folder to protect: You change the protectedFolder line to the path of your folder (e.g., protectedFolder := "D:\MySecretStuff").
  • Set the password: You don't put your password directly in the script. Instead, you use Script 1 to convert your desired password into an MD5 hash, and then you paste that hash into the storedPasswordHash line.

  - How it works, step-by-step:
  1. You run the script. It sits quietly in the background, visible as an icon in your system tray (the area with the clock and volume control).
  2. You right-click on its icon to see a menu with options.
  3. To Lock (Hide) the Folder:
      • You click "Lock Folder" in the menu.
      • The folder instantly becomes hidden.
  4. To Unlock (Show) the Folder:
      • You click "Unlock Folder" in the menu.
      • A password box appears.
      • You type your password and click OK.
      • If the password is correct, the folder becomes visible and opens in a File Explorer window for you.
      • If the password is wrong, you get an "Access Denied" message.

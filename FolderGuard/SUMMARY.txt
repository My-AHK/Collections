
*  MD5 string converter and folder lock utility.


PURPOSE:  
The first script provides a simple utility for converting any user-input string into its MD5 hash equivalent, displaying the result, and copying it directly to the clipboard. 
The second script serves as a folder protection mechanism, enabling the user to lock and unlock a designated directory with password verification through MD5 hashing. 
Together, they showcase practical applications of MD5 hashing in everyday tasks such as quick conversions and basic data security.

KEY FEATURES:  
The first script centers on lightweight conversion while the second focuses on access control for a chosen folder. 
Both employ an MD5 hashing function to ensure secure handling of user data, but they diverge in scope and complexity.  
   • Script 1 uses a minimal InputBox/MsgBox approach for string-to-hash conversions.  
   • Script 2 integrates folder hiding/unhiding, password checking, and a tray menu system.  
   • Both scripts leverage the same MD5 function, demonstrating modular code reuse.  
   • The clipboard feature in Script 1 allows quick sharing of hashed strings.  
   • The protection logic in Script 2 balances ease of use with a simple security layer.

LOGIC SUMMARY:  
   • Script 1 begins by requesting a string from the user, then verifies that the action wasn’t canceled. 
If valid, the string is passed into an MD5 function, and the result is displayed alongside the original. 
The hash is simultaneously copied to the clipboard for convenience.  
   • Script 2 sets up a protected folder path and a stored password hash. If the folder does not exist, it is created automatically. 
The system tray is populated with options to lock, unlock, or exit the script. 
Locking hides the folder using system attributes, while unlocking requires entering a password. 
The input password is hashed and compared to the stored value, and if correct, the folder is unhidden and opened in Explorer. 
Incorrect attempts trigger an access denied warning.  
   • Both scripts conclude with the same MD5 function, a compact yet effective hashing routine.  
   • Script 1 emphasizes speed and simplicity.  
   • Script 2 extends the hash usage into a functional security tool.  

LAYOUT:  
Both scripts are cleanly structured with clear comment markers, separating configuration areas, logic blocks, and supporting functions.  
   • Script 1 has a linear flow: input → hashing → display → clipboard.  
   • Script 2 organizes sections with headers: configuration, hotkeys, folder checks, menu creation, lock/unlock logic, exit handling, and hashing.  
   • Each script is self-contained but could be integrated, showing design flexibility.  
   • Use of `Return` statements provides clear termination points and structure.  
   • Comments in both scripts maintain a consistent style, aiding readability.

USER EXPERIENCE:  
   The first script offers a direct experience: the user types a string, receives its MD5 hash instantly, and benefits from automatic clipboard copying. 
This workflow is fast, with minimal friction for quick lookups or encoding tasks.  
   The second script offers a more interactive security tool. 
Users gain a protected folder accessible through a tray menu. 
Locking and unlocking actions are communicated with sound cues and message boxes, providing feedback and assurance of success or failure. 
Although the protection is limited to obscuring the folder and requiring a password, it serves as an effective lightweight solution for casual use.  
   • Script 1 is best suited for users needing quick one-off MD5 conversions.  
   • Script 2 is better for those seeking an easy folder protection utility without installing external programs.  
   • Both scripts prioritize clarity, responsiveness, and user guidance through message prompts.  
   • Their shared use of MD5 ties them together, reinforcing the idea of consistent hashing utilities across different applications.

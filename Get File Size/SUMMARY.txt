
*  Multi-unit file size viewer - copy, convert, compare.

Purpose:
   Provides a drag-and-drop and button-driven GUI for selecting a file 
   and displaying its size in user-selected units: Bytes, KB, MB, GB, 
   and TB. Intended for quick inspection, conversion, and copy-ready 
   formatting of file sizes.
   • Supports five different unit outputs.
   • Outputs are visually aligned using monospaced font.
   • Usable for development, documentation, or diagnostics.

Key Features:
   The script uses a GUI-based workflow to retrieve, calculate, and 
   present a file’s size in selected formats, offering copy functionality 
   and styled layout.
   • GUI includes:
       ⮞ Unit size checkboxes: Bytes, KB, MB, GB, TB.
           ⮚ All can be toggled individually.
           ⮚ User must select at least one to display size.
       ⮞ File input via:
           ⮞ Manual file picker (button).
           ⮞ Edit field with path.
           ⮞ Drag-and-drop support.
       ⮞ Results area with monospaced alignment.
       ⮞ Buttons:
           ⮞ “Get File” — opens file selector.
           ⮞ “View && Copy” — previews and copies result.
           ⮞ “HOME” — reloads GUI/script.
           ⮞ “EXIT” — terminates script.
   • Error feedback:
       ⮞ File not found message.
       ⮞ File access error message.
       ⮞ Warning when no unit size selected.
   • Clipboard-ready format:
       ⮞ Clean formatting with aligned labels and precision.
       ⮞ Excludes GUI-specific headings when copied.

Logic Summary:
   User selects a file, chooses desired output units, and receives a 
   live preview. Formatting is handled dynamically with internal 
   precision control and label padding.
   • File selection:
       ⮞ Initiated by button or drag-drop event.
       ⮞ Path stored in `File` variable.
   • Unit list is internally constructed:
       ⮞ Contains label, divisor, decimal count, and checkbox state.
       ⮞ Longest label determines column alignment spacing.
   • Size output:
       ⮞ For each selected unit:
           ⮞ Calculates file size using unit’s divisor.
           ⮞ Formats number to specified decimal precision.
           ⮞ Aligns label to right using space-padding.
           ⮞ Appends size with label and line break.
   • Display:
       ⮞ Result injected into GUI control `ResultDisplay`.
       ⮞ Refreshes with every interaction change.

Layout:
   The GUI layout is vertically stacked with emphasis on readability 
   and interactivity.
   • Top section:
       ⮞ Instructional heading.
   • Middle section:
       ⮞ Checkboxes arranged in a row.
       ⮞ File selection below.
   • Output area:
       ⮞ Large multi-line text block styled for alignment.
   • Right side:
       ⮞ Vertically aligned control buttons:
           ⮞ “View && Copy”
           ⮞ “HOME”
           ⮞ “EXIT”
   • Font usage:
       ⮞ Times New Roman for header.
       ⮞ Arial for body text/buttons.
       ⮞ Consolas for output results.
       ⮞ Calibri for vertical menu controls.

User Experience:
   The interface prioritizes simplicity and precision with minimal 
   clutter and immediate feedback.
   • Realtime updates on file or checkbox change.
   • Copy-friendly output without GUI markup.
   • Font and color styling provide visual structure.
   • Supports keyboardless workflows via drag & drop.
   • All critical actions are just one or two clicks away.

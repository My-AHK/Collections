
*  File renaming GUI with append, prepend, numbering.

PURPOSE:
This script provides a graphical AutoHotkey-based utility for safely renaming multiple files within a selected folder by appending or prepending custom text and optional sequential numbering. 
It emphasizes preview-first behavior to reduce errors and gives the user granular control over filename structure before committing changes.
   • Enables bulk file renaming without manual command-line usage.
   • Focuses on clarity, preview accuracy, and confirmation before execution.
   • Designed for repeat use through reloadable and persistent GUI behavior.

KEY FEATURES:
The script offers a comprehensive set of filename modification options through a single always-on-top GUI, combining text insertion, separator control, and configurable numbering logic. 
All transformations are previewed live before being applied.
   • Folder selection with live file list population.
       ⮞ Supports optional inclusion of subfolders.
   • Append or prepend custom text to filenames.
       ⮞ User-defined separator character(s).
   • Sequential numbering system with padding control.
       ⮞ Configurable start number.
       ⮞ Zero-padded numbering (e.g., 001, 002).
       ⮞ Number placement before or after custom text.
   • Live preview of renamed filenames.
       ⮞ Displayed directly in the ListView.
   • Selective file processing.
       ⮞ Individual checkboxes per file.
       ⮞ Select All / Deselect All controls.
   • Safe execution workflow.
       ⮞ Confirmation dialog before renaming.
       ⮞ Error reporting with per-file failure logging.
   • Reload and exit controls for rapid iteration.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script maintains an internal array of file objects representing each discovered file, storing its full path, base name, extension, and directory. 
GUI input controls directly influence how new filenames are generated, and a shared generation function ensures consistency between preview and actual rename operations.
   • File discovery:
       ⮞ Files are gathered using a Loop, Files construct.
       ⮞ Directories are explicitly skipped.
   • Data modeling:
       ⮞ Each file is stored as an object containing name components.
   • Preview generation:
       ⮞ Iterates through ListView rows.
       ⮞ Uses a sequential counter to simulate numbering.
       ⮞ Calls a centralized filename generator.
   • Filename construction:
       ⮞ Applies prepend or append logic.
       ⮞ Inserts numbering based on user-selected position.
       ⮞ Preserves file extensions.
   • Rename execution:
       ⮞ Processes only checked files.
       ⮞ Reuses the same generation logic as preview.
       ⮞ Tracks success and failure counts.
   • Error handling:
       ⮞ Failed operations are logged and displayed post-run.

LAYOUT:
The GUI is compact, borderless, and always on top, designed for efficiency rather than decoration.
Controls are grouped logically to guide the user from folder selection through preview and execution.
   • Top section:
       ⮞ Folder path display with browse button.
   • Text configuration:
       ⮞ Append/prepend text input.
       ⮞ Separator input with usage examples.
       ⮞ Radio buttons for prepend vs append.
   • Numbering section:
       ⮞ Checkbox to enable numbering.
       ⮞ Inputs for start number and padding.
       ⮞ Radio buttons for number placement.
   • File list:
       ⮞ ListView with columns for selection, current name, new name, and path.
       ⮞ Grid-enabled for readability.
   • Action buttons:
       ⮞ Select/Deselect all.
       ⮞ Preview and Rename.
       ⮞ Reload and Exit.

USER EXPERIENCE:
The script prioritizes safety, transparency, and user confidence by ensuring that no file is renamed without explicit selection, preview, and confirmation. 
Immediate visual feedback and clear messaging reduce the risk of accidental or malformed renames.
   • Predictable behavior through live previews.
   • No irreversible actions without confirmation.
   • Errors are clearly reported without halting the entire process.
   • Fast iteration enabled via reload functionality.
   • Minimal distractions due to captionless, focused GUI design.

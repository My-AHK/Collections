
*  Hotkey control & safeguard for Task Manager access

PURPOSE:  
The purpose of these scripts is to control access to Task Manager on Windows systems. 
The primary script provides hotkeys that allow an administrator to disable or enable Task Manager dynamically by modifying specific registry entries. 
The companion script acts as a safety measure by ensuring that if the main script is not running, the registry is automatically reverted to prevent Task Manager from remaining permanently blocked. 
Together, they create a controlled and reversible method of restricting Task Manager access.

❗❗ EDITS REGISTRY - USE WITH CAUTION ❗❗

KEY FEATURES:  
The main script is designed for administrators who need to temporarily prevent or restore Task Manager access through registry edits. 
The companion script ensures system stability by preventing a permanent lockout if the main script is closed or terminated unexpectedly.  
   • Auto-elevates itself to administrator level if not already running with elevated privileges.  
   • Provides hotkeys for enabling (Win+1) and disabling (Win+2) Task Manager.  
   • Uses the Windows “Image File Execution Options” registry path to redirect or block Task Manager.  
   • Tracks script ownership of registry edits to ensure responsible cleanup.  
   • Registers handlers for both script termination and system shutdown/reboot, ensuring registry cleanup.  
   • Companion script monitors the primary script’s process and automatically reverts changes if the main script is missing.  
   • Companion script runs in the background and can be set to autostart with Windows for fail-safe protection.  

LOGIC SUMMARY:  
The main script executes by checking administrator status and self-elevating if needed. 
It registers handlers to intercept both script exit and system shutdown so that registry edits are reversed if the script is responsible for them. 
Hotkeys are used to either disable Task Manager by writing a “Debugger” entry under the `Image File Execution Options` registry path or to re-enable Task Manager by removing those entries.  

**Image File Execution Options (IFEO)**  (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/xperf/image-file-execution-options)
IFEO is a Windows feature that allows developers and administrators to intercept how executables are launched by the system. 
By setting a “Debugger” value under the IFEO registry path for a program (e.g., `taskmgr.exe`), Windows will not launch the program normally but instead attempt to run the debugger command defined in the value. 
In this script, a harmless string (“Hotkey Disabled”) is written as the debugger, effectively blocking Task Manager from running. 
Removing this entry restores Task Manager functionality.  
   • Main script logic:  
       ⮞ Auto-elevate to admin for registry access.  
       ⮞ Provide hotkeys for enable/disable control.  
       ⮞ Use IFEO “Debugger” entries to block Task Manager.  
       ⮞ Track ownership of registry changes to ensure responsible cleanup.  
       ⮞ Handle shutdown/reboot with registry rollback.  
   • Companion script logic:  
       ⮞ Run on startup or in parallel with the main script.  
       ⮞ Periodically check if the main script is active.  
       ⮞ If missing, restore Task Manager access and then exit.  

LAYOUT:  
The main script follows a structured layout with sections for setup, hotkey definitions, registry modification routines, and shutdown/exit handlers. 
Registry manipulation is contained within labeled subroutines (`Enable`, `Disable`, `ExitSub`) for clarity. 
The companion script is intentionally minimal, containing a single infinite loop with periodic checks and restoration logic if required. 
This modular approach keeps the main script interactive while leaving the companion script as a passive safeguard.  
   • Main script structure:  
       ⮞ Initialization: Admin check and auto-elevation.  
       ⮞ Hotkeys: Win+1 to enable, Win+2 to disable Task Manager.  
       ⮞ Subroutines: Registry writing/deleting with error handling.  
       ⮞ Exit handling: Cleanup of registry values upon exit or shutdown.  
   • Companion script structure:  
       ⮞ Loop with process monitoring.  
       ⮞ Conditional cleanup if main script not running.  
       ⮞ Sleep interval for efficient resource usage.  

USER EXPERIENCE:  
The user experience is focused on simplicity, reliability, and safety. 
The primary script provides instant control of Task Manager access via straightforward hotkeys. 
Administrative elevation is automated, eliminating manual restarts with elevated rights. 
Users are protected from accidental or permanent loss of Task Manager since the script self-cleans registry entries on shutdown or script exit. 
The companion script adds an additional safeguard, ensuring Task Manager is restored even if the main script is forcibly closed. 
For administrators or IT staff, this provides peace of mind and a controlled environment without complex configuration.  
   • Hotkeys allow quick toggling without navigating registry or policy editors.  
   • Automatic admin elevation reduces friction for the user.  
   • Error handling notifies the user if registry edits fail.  
   • Registry ownership tracking ensures only the script’s changes are removed.  
   • Companion script creates a fail-safe system for stability.  
   • Startup integration makes long-term management seamless.

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
  • Antivirus Detection: IFEO edits may be flagged as malicious.
  • Modern Windows Versions: Newer protections can block registry changes.
  • Alternative Task Managers: Windows Task Manager is completely blocked, but other tools remain usable.
  • System Recovery: If both scripts are killed, power failure, could leave Task Manager disabled until fixed manually. Simply run the companion script or put in your startup folder.

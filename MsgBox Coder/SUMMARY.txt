
*  MsgBox Coder — Interactive MsgBox Generator with Test and Clipboard Export.

Purpose:
   A highly customizable GUI utility that generates AutoHotkey `MsgBox` code with user-defined parameters. 
   Users can preview, copy, and test the message box format instantly, including timeouts, icons, button configurations, and modality.

Key Features:
   • Full GUI for constructing MsgBox commands with real-time code generation.
   • One-click testing and clipboard export of the generated command.
   • Visual icon previews and tooltip explanations for UI elements.

GUI Components:
   • **Title & Message Input**:
       ⮞ Custom text fields to define the title and message body.
       ⮞ Handles newline and quote escaping automatically.
   • **Button Configuration**:
       ⮞ Radio options for standard MsgBox button sets:
          OK, OK/Cancel, Yes/No, Retry/Cancel, etc.
   • **Default Button Selection**:
       ⮞ Choose which button is the default (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
   • **Timeout Control**:
       ⮞ Optional timeout duration in seconds.
       ⮞ Field becomes enabled only when checkbox is active.
       ⮞ Validates numeric input before generating output.
   • **Icon Selection**:
       ⮞ Choose an icon (Error, Question, Warning, Info).
       ⮞ Previews icons using system DLL (user32.dll or user.exe).
   • **Modality Options**:
       ⮞ Task modal, System modal, or Always on Top.
   • **Action Buttons**:
       ⮞ `Clipboard && Test`: Generates the MsgBox line, copies to clipboard,
          and immediately displays the resulting MsgBox.
       ⮞ `Help`: Opens AutoHotkey documentation for MsgBox.
       ⮞ `Close && Exit`: Exits the script.

Functionality Details:
   • `EscapeForMsgBox(str)`:
       ⮞ Escapes quotes and newlines for safe embedding in AHK script code.
   • Tooltip Support:
       ⮞ Hovering over buttons shows helpful usage hints.
       ⮞ Tooltips dynamically created with `GuiTip()` using Windows API.
   • Output Logic:
       ⮞ Combines all selected flags using bitwise OR.
       ⮞ Timeout is appended only if checkbox is active.
       ⮞ Validated final code is placed in the clipboard.

Design Notes:
   • Sleek dark-themed interface: custom font, borderless GUI, and controlled width.
   • Compact layout — fits in 333×455 GUI window.
   • Automatically adjusts icon source based on Windows version.

Ideal Use:
   • Script developers seeking a reliable MsgBox formatter.
   • Training, education, and prototyping of AHK dialog behaviors.
   • Easily paste MsgBox templates into any AutoHotkey v1.1 script.

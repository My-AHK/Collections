
*  Organizes files into named folders via hotkey.


PURPOSE:
This script automates the task of organizing files in Windows Explorer by creating individual folders for each selected file and moving the file into its corresponding folder. It ensures better file management by preventing clutter and maintaining a cleaner directory structure.

KEY FEATURES:
The script provides a seamless, one-key shortcut (`Ctrl+T`) that activates only within Windows Explorer. It performs several safety checks to avoid accidental mismanagement, such as excluding folders from processing and alerting the user if none or invalid items are selected.
   • AutoHotkey hotkey (Ctrl+T) for activation.
   • Selects and evaluates files directly from Explorer.
   • Prevents folder selection to avoid processing errors.
   • Creates uniquely named folders based on each file name.
   • Moves the file into its new folder.
   • Displays result summary, including error counts and details.
   • Refreshes Explorer to reflect changes immediately.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
Upon activation, the script gathers all currently selected items in the active Windows Explorer window. It verifies the selections, excluding folders and proceeding only if at least one file is selected. Each file is used to create a new folder named after the file (excluding the extension), and the file is then moved into this folder. Any issues encountered during folder creation or file movement are logged and shown in a final results dialog.
   • Uses `ComObjCreate("Shell.Application")` to access Explorer selections.
   • Filters out directory items to ensure only files are processed.
   • Uses `SplitPath` to extract filenames and construct folder paths.
   • Relocates files using `FileMove` into newly created directories.
   • Counts and reports successful and failed operations.
   • Sends `{F5}` to force an Explorer refresh after processing.

LAYOUT:
The script begins with a hotkey definition and scope limited to Windows Explorer. It defines the main logic under the hotkey label and contains a supporting function, `GetSelectedFiles`, which retrieves selected Explorer items. At the end, a tooltip displays upon script startup with a timed auto-hide.
   • Hotkey logic block under `^t::` handles validation, folder creation, and file movement.
   • A helper function `GetSelectedFiles()` centralizes the selection logic.
   • Tooltip on startup informs the user about script readiness.
   • `SetTimer` used to remove the tooltip after 3 seconds.

USER EXPERIENCE:
The script runs transparently within Windows Explorer and provides helpful feedback throughout the process. Users receive immediate notifications if errors occur or no valid files are selected, ensuring clarity and minimizing mistakes. The automatic folder naming saves time and reduces manual tasks, and visual feedback through dialog boxes enhances usability.
   • Intuitive Ctrl+T trigger for instant activation.
   • Prevents common errors through selection filtering.
   • Success/failure dialogs summarize the outcome clearly.
   • Startup tooltip offers brief onboarding without interrupting workflow.


* Clickable GUI hyperlinks with hover effects


PURPOSE:
This script creates a clickable, interactive GUI featuring multiple labeled web links, each opening a different website when clicked. 
It simulates hyperlink behavior within a standard AutoHotkey GUI by detecting mouse movement and changing the cursor to a hand icon when hovering over specific controls. 
It enhances the user interface by mimicking web-like interactivity inside a native script window.

KEY FEATURES:
The GUI displays four stacked URLs, each associated with a different website. 
When the mouse cursor hovers over one of these links, the text becomes underlined and the cursor changes to a pointing hand - a familiar visual indicator of a clickable link. 
Clicking any URL triggers a `Run` command to open the corresponding website.
   • Displays four individual clickable URL links
   • Hover effect: underlined text + hand cursor
   • Each link opens a distinct website using `Run`
   • Uses `OnMessage()` for precise mouse tracking
   • Auto-detects which control is under the cursor
   • Handles state cleanup when cursor leaves a link

LOGIC SUMMARY:
Upon launch, the GUI is built with labeled `Text` controls assigned to `gLabels`, each serving as a link. 
The script stores the process ID and window handle to uniquely identify its own GUI. 
Two Windows messages — `WM_MOUSEMOVE` and `WM_SETCURSOR` — are intercepted using `OnMessage()` to implement hover-based interactivity. 
If the mouse moves over a control starting with "URL", the script underlines the text and sets the cursor to a hand pointer. 
When the mouse leaves, it resets the cursor and font.
   • Mouse movement triggers `HandleMessage()`
   • Control name prefix “URL” identifies clickable links
   • Font and cursor change dynamically on hover
   • Prevents redundant updates by tracking last hovered control
   • Message handling is isolated and efficient

LAYOUT:
The layout is simple and vertically stacked, starting with a header followed by a list of links. 
Each link is a text control aligned below the previous, ensuring consistent spacing and visual grouping. 
The use of margins keeps the interface readable and evenly spaced.
   • Top: Static text header (“Multiple URLs in one GUI”)
   • Below: Four individual blue-colored text items
   • Padding and margin ensure clarity and clickability
   • Entire window styled using `Gui, Margin` and spacing logic

USER EXPERIENCE:
Users interact with this GUI as they would on a webpage: hovering over links gives a familiar visual response, and clicking launches a browser to the associated site. 
The experience is intuitive, responsive, and immediately recognizable. 
The hover logic ensures links stand out and convey functionality, without relying on external libraries or GUI libraries.
   • Seamless hover feedback with underline + hand cursor
   • Click-based interaction feels like navigating a mini web portal
   • Non-obtrusive and focused on function over form
   • Uses native AHK constructs while enhancing interface quality
   • Offers useful demonstration for creating web-like GUIs in AHK

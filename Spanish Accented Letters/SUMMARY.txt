
*  Quick Spanish accent typing via ALT double-tap mode.

PURPOSE:
This script enables users to easily type Spanish accented characters and punctuation by temporarily entering a special "Accent Mode" through a double-tap of the ALT key. 
It simplifies the input of characters like á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ, ¡, ¿ and their capitalized forms without switching keyboard layouts. 
The script is designed for efficiency and minimizes disruption to regular typing.

KEY FEATURES:
The script activates a temporary mode for typing Spanish characters, which automatically disables itself after use or after a timeout period. 
It offers user guidance through tooltips and sound cues, and provides a built-in help system for reference.
   • Double-tap ALT to enable Accent Mode.
   • Active keys: a, e, i, o, u, n, !, ? → accented characters; Shift variants produce uppercase accented letters.
   • ESC exits Accent Mode without sending a character.
   • Mode auto-cancels after 5 seconds or after a character is sent.
   • Ctrl+Alt+H shows help instructions in a message box.
   • Ctrl+Alt+Q allows for a clean exit of the script.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script relies on tracking ALT key presses within a short interval to detect a double-tap. 
If triggered, it enables hotkeys for Spanish characters, provides a tooltip notification, and plays a system sound. 
Sending an accented character or pressing ESC deactivates Accent Mode. 
Background timers ensure that single taps reset correctly and that Accent Mode cancels automatically if unused.
   • A counter increments with each ALT press and is reduced by a timer.
   • A value of 2 within 750ms activates Accent Mode.
   • Another timer enforces auto-cancel at 5 seconds.
   • Accent hotkeys send specific characters and immediately exit the mode.
   • Helper functions cleanly disable all active hotkeys and tooltips.

LAYOUT:
The script is structured with clear labels, timers, and functions to ensure modular handling of each feature. 
Initialization disables accent hotkeys by default, which are enabled only in Accent Mode. 
Dedicated subroutines handle tooltips, cancellation, and cleanup to maintain stability.
   • ALT hotkeys track taps and trigger activation.
   • Separate labels exist for each accented character and uppercase version.
   • Utility functions (DisableAccentMode) reset state, timers, and hotkeys.
   • A help dialog outlines all usage instructions.

USER EXPERIENCE:
The script is designed to be intuitive, requiring only a double-tap of ALT to activate. 
Clear visual and audio feedback indicates when Accent Mode is active, reducing guesswork. 
Automatic cancellation prevents accidental keystrokes from producing accented characters after delays. 
The inclusion of ESC as a manual cancel key and Ctrl+Alt+H as a help shortcut ensures smooth usability for both beginners and advanced users.
   • Fast entry and exit of Accent Mode with minimal keystrokes.
   • Immediate character input with a single press.
   • Built-in safeguards against accidental accent typing.
   • Lightweight and unobtrusive integration into daily typing.


*  Precision second-based timer with toggleable hotkeys.

PURPOSE:
This script functions as a high-precision timing assistant, designed to execute specific actions at exact moments within a minute-long cycle. 
It provides a persistent, on-screen GUI that displays the current second and the status of two toggleable hotkeys, F1 and F2. 
The core utility lies in its ability to trigger distinct audio-visual alerts precisely at the 15/45-second and 00/30-second marks, 
respectively, making it ideal for users who need to perform time-sensitive tasks synchronized to the system clock.

KEY FEATURES:
The script's functionality is built around two main hotkeys and a precision timer, all monitored by a compact GUI.
   •   Toggleable Hotkeys (F1 & F2):
       ⮞   F1 is programmed to activate its routine at the 15-second and 45-second marks of any minute.
       ⮞   F2 is programmed to activate its routine at the 00-second and 30-second marks of any minute.
   •   High-Precision Timing:
           ⮚   Utilizes the Windows API's `QueryPerformanceCounter` for microsecond-accurate timing measurements, far surpassing the standard `A_TickCount`.
   •   Visual Status Interface:
       ⮞   A small, always-on-top GUI displays the current second, the status of each hotkey (ENABLED/DISABLED), and a running elapsed time counter.
   •   User Feedback:
           ⮚   Audible beeps confirm the toggling of hotkeys and the execution of their timed routines.
           ⮚   Tooltips provide immediate, context-sensitive status updates and performance metrics near the mouse cursor.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script operates through a continuous loop managed by timers. The `PrecisionTimer` subroutine, which runs every 100 milliseconds, is the heart of the timing mechanism. 
It calculates the current time with high precision and checks if the conditions for triggering the F1 or F2 actions are met. 
This check involves verifying that the hotkey is active, the current system second matches the target (15/45 for F1, 00/30 for F2), 
and that a cooldown period (900ms) has passed since the last trigger to prevent multiple firings within the same target second. 
When conditions are satisfied, it launches the corresponding action subroutine (`F1_Action` or `F2_Action`) with the highest priority. 
A separate `UpdateGUI` timer frequently refreshes the on-screen display to show the current status and elapsed time.

LAYOUT:
The user interface is a small, borderless window strategically positioned in the bottom-right corner of the primary monitor by default. Its design is minimalist and focused on functionality.
   •   Primary Display: A large, central number shows the current second of the minute.
   •   Status Indicators: Two lines of text below the large number show the enabled/disabled state of the F1 and F2 hotkeys, changing color and font size for emphasis.
   •   Information Line: A line at the top shows the total milliseconds elapsed since the script started.
   •   Exit Control: A clickable "EXIT" text label is provided at the bottom to terminate the script.

USER EXPERIENCE:
Interaction is simple and intuitive. 
The user presses F1 or F2 to toggle the respective timer on or off, receiving an audible beep and a temporary tooltip for confirmation. 
Once enabled, the script runs autonomously in the background. 
The user is notified of a successful trigger with a unique beep and a detailed tooltip that reports the subroutine's response time in microseconds, providing valuable performance feedback. 
The GUI serves as a constant, unobtrusive reference for the current time and hotkey status. 
The script is exited gracefully by either clicking the "EXIT" text on the GUI or pressing the Escape key.

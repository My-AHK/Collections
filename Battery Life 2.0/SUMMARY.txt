
*  Displays detailed battery and power info



Purpose:      Retrieves detailed system power and battery information using the Windows API `GetSystemPowerStatus`.

Features:
   • Determines if the system is connected to AC power (Online/Offline/Unknown).
   • Reads battery status flag and provides human-readable interpretation (e.g., Charging, Critical).
   • Displays battery charge as a percentage.
   • Calculates and formats estimated time remaining and full charge time.

Operation Flow:
    1. Allocates a 12-byte memory buffer for power status data.
    2. Calls the `GetSystemPowerStatus` API and checks for success.
    3. Parses individual data fields using `GetInteger()` to interpret:
           • AC line status
           • Battery flag
           • Battery life percentage
           • Time remaining (in seconds)
           • Full battery life (in seconds)
    4. Uses conditional logic to convert raw values into meaningful descriptions.
    5. Converts battery life durations into human-readable strings (e.g., "1 hour 23 minutes").
    6. Displays a message box summarizing the current power and battery state.

Supporting Functions:
   • `GetInteger()` extracts multi-byte integer values from a binary buffer.
   • `GetFormatedTime()` converts seconds into formatted time strings.

Requirements:
   • AutoHotkey v1.1 or later.
   • Windows OS with support for the `GetSystemPowerStatus` API.

OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
    A message box might display:
    ```
    AC Status: Online
    Battery state and capacity: Charging
    Battery Life: 78%
    Remaining Battery Life: 2 hours 15 minutes
    Full Battery Life: 3 hours 5 minutes
    ```

This script is useful for quick insights into system power state, particularly helpful for battery-powered devices or diagnostics.

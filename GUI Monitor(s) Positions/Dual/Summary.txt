
Designed to manage and reposition a GUI window across two monitors using keyboard shortcuts. It emphasizes maintainable and clear coordinate-based positioning, with predefined hotkey mappings for both alphanumeric and numpad keys. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components and functionality:

GUI Setup
GUI Creation: The script defines a basic GUI window (200x150 pixels) with a red background and yellow/black text.
The text explains how to use the GUI with Ctrl or Alt and alphanumeric or numpad keys to reposition the window.
Default Positioning: The window is initially hidden, then shown at the "Down, Horizontal-Center" (D HC) position on the primary monitor (Monitor 1).
Keyboard Shortcuts
Control (Ctrl) Shortcuts:

Ctrl combined with alphanumeric or numpad keys (1-9) repositions the GUI within Monitor 1.
Positions include:
Corners: (Down Left, Up Right, etc.)
Center alignments: (Vertical-Center, Horizontal-Center, etc.)
Each key corresponds to a specific location (e.g., Ctrl+1 places the GUI in "Down, Left").
Alt (Alt) Shortcuts:

Similar to Ctrl shortcuts but targets Monitor 2.
Users can switch monitors and reposition the GUI by replacing Ctrl with Alt while using the same key mapping.
Positioning Logic
WinMove Function:
Handles the actual repositioning of the GUI window.
Accounts for:
Monitor boundaries using SysGet.
Work area dimensions for primary (MonitorWorkArea) and secondary monitors.
Cartesian positioning (Up, Vertical-Center, Down, etc.) to determine the exact window location.
Adjusts calculations based on whether the target monitor is 1 (primary) or 2 (secondary).
Special Features
Cartesian Position Labels:

Horizontal (L, HC, R) and vertical (U, VC, D) labels simplify the positioning logic.
Short, descriptive labels make the code intuitive and easier to maintain.
Default Hidden Window Behavior:

The script ensures the GUI window remains functional even if hidden using A_DetectHiddenWindows.
Hotkey Flexibility:

Users can toggle between monitors and switch layouts seamlessly without editing the script.
Scalability:

The design can be expanded to support additional monitors or dynamic positioning without significant structural changes.

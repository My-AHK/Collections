
Creates a simple GUI for testing and offers a flexible system for positioning the GUI on a secondary monitor using keyboard shortcuts. The core features include a visually styled GUI and precise control over its placement using Alt + alphanumeric or Numpad keys. Below are the details:

Key Features
GUI Design:

Dimensions: 200x150 pixels.
Appearance:
Background: Red.
Fonts:
Large yellow text for the title ("Basic Gui For Testing").
Smaller black text for instructions.
Initial Placement: Bottom-center of the secondary monitor.
Hotkey Functionality:

Alt + numeric keys (1-9) or Numpad keys are used to reposition the GUI.
Predefined positions:
1/Numpad1: Bottom-left.
2/Numpad2: Bottom-center.
3/Numpad3: Bottom-right.
4/Numpad4: Center-left.
5/Numpad5: Center.
6/Numpad6: Center-right.
7/Numpad7: Top-left.
8/Numpad8: Top-center.
9/Numpad9: Top-right.
Custom WinMove Function:

A robust function to calculate and set positions based on a shorthand coordinate system:
Horizontal (L, HC, R).
Vertical (U, VC, D).
Supports a dual-monitor setup, focusing on placing the GUI on the secondary monitor.
Coordinate System:

Cartesian shorthand makes positions intuitive and maintainable.
Shorthand conversion (e.g., replacing b with d) ensures compatibility with internal logic.
Workflow:

On startup, the GUI is created and positioned in the bottom-center of the secondary monitor.
Users can move the GUI dynamically using predefined Alt + key shortcuts.
Efficiency and Adaptability:
Uses SysGet to fetch monitor dimensions, ensuring accurate placement regardless of screen resolution or layout.
StringReplace and InStr methods handle coordinate parsing, reducing potential for error.
Brief Summary
Alt + Numpad script moves GUI across secondary monitor.

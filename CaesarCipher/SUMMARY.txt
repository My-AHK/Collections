
*  Caesar Cipher GUI with live slider preview.


PURPOSE:
This script provides a user-friendly interface to encode or decode text using the Caesar Cipher. It simplifies experimentation with different shift values and allows for real-time visual feedback, making it both educational and practical for basic cryptographic use.

KEY FEATURES:
The script includes essential Caesar Cipher functionality wrapped in an interactive GUI, with persistent shift settings and clipboard integration.
   • Supports both encoding and decoding through buttons.
   • Displays real-time output as the user adjusts the shift slider.
   • Remembers the last used shift value using an INI file.
   • Copies results to the clipboard for quick access.
   • Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters accurately.
   • Leaves non-letter characters unmodified.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The CaesarCipher function iterates through each character of the input text and applies a modular shift transformation to alphabetic characters. It uses ASCII value calculations to perform the rotation and preserves the case of each letter.
   • For lowercase letters:
       ⮞ Calculates new position with `Mod(asc - 97 + shift, 26)`.
   • For uppercase letters:
       ⮞ Uses similar logic with base `65` for 'A'.
   • Negative shifts are handled gracefully by adjusting results back into the alphabetic range.
   • All other characters are appended unchanged.

LAYOUT:
The graphical layout is designed for clarity and ease of use, with color-coded sections and labels.
   • Two large edit boxes:
       ⮞ Left: user input.
       ⮞ Right: output preview.
   • Slider control beneath input box for adjusting shift.
   • Buttons for "Encode" and "Decode" to finalize and copy results.
   • Dynamic status message area for clipboard feedback.
   • Shift value is prominently displayed and updates live.

USER EXPERIENCE:
Users can enter a message and instantly preview the result of Caesar encoding or decoding as they adjust the shift. This interactivity makes the script engaging and easy to experiment with.
   • Slider feedback is immediate, eliminating trial-and-error typing.
   • Buttons provide clipboard-ready output with confirmation.
   • Simple layout and helpful colors improve usability.
   • Persistent settings encourage repeat use without reconfiguration.

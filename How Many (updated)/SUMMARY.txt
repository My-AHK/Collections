
* Compare object sizes with fun unit scaling


PURPOSE:
This script is an interactive comparison tool that allows users to input a custom length or height and see how many of that unit would fit into a variety of real-world objects. 
Designed with educational and entertainment purposes in mind, it bridges fun trivia and basic unit conversion. 
It supports both metric and imperial systems and includes visual guides, descriptions, and ratio-based outputs for comparative scaling.

KEY FEATURES:
The script supports a diverse set of reference objects, including people, animals, candies, devices, and landmarks. 
Users can enter measurements in either metric or imperial units, select an object from a list, and view detailed comparisons showing how many of their input units equal the dimensions of the selected object.
   • Includes 30+ predefined real-world reference objects
   • Supports both metric and imperial input
   • Real-time update as measurements or units change
   • Results formatted in a clean, column-aligned output
   • Offers per-object details like width, height, thickness, etc.
   • Hotkey support for help and about dialogs

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script builds a GUI with a listbox for selecting a reference object and edit boxes for entering length in miles/km, feet/m, and inches/cm depending on the selected unit system. 
A unified `dimensions` object stores each item’s measurements. 
The user’s input is converted to centimeters, and ratios are calculated to determine how many of those units would equal each dimension of the chosen object. 
The results are shown in a read-only multiline box with neatly aligned formatting.
   • Input fields accept multi-tiered dimensional input (e.g., miles + feet + inches)
   • Internally converts all input to centimeters
   • Iterates through each property of the selected object
   • Calculates a "how many of your input" ratio for each dimension
   • Result text is formatted into aligned columns using a custom `columns()` function
   • Outputs are updated dynamically on input or selection changes

LAYOUT:
The interface is split into logical sections: input on the right, object list on the left, and output below. 
The top explains the user prompt, followed by radio buttons for unit selection, then numerical input fields. 
The lower half of the GUI displays the live result text box.
   • Left pane: Object selector list
   • Right pane: Unit system radio buttons and 3 input fields (distance hierarchy)
   • Bottom pane: Labeled result area with scrollable comparison results
   • Pop-up windows: For Help, Unit Info, and visual guides
   • Custom MsgBox utility used for formatted dialogs

USER EXPERIENCE:
Users can explore how tall or long something is in relatable terms, such as “how many iPhones tall is the Hoover Dam.” 
The interface is immediate, colorful, and responsive. 
Metric/Imperial switching is seamless, and tooltips guide usage. 
The script includes help prompts, detailed notes, and is ideal for fun measurement comparisons, classroom use, or light educational tools.
   • Easily navigate through object list with mouse or keys
   • Intuitive layout encourages experimentation
   • Dynamic results provide instant feedback
   • Hotkeys (`F1`, `?`, `Esc`) improve usability
   • Meant for fun, not scientific accuracy

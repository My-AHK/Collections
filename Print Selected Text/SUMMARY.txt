
*  Clipboard to Printer — Quick Print Selected Text via Notepad.

Purpose:
   Instantly prints the current text selection by copying it to a temporary file, sending it to notepad’s print command, and cleaning up afterward.

Activation:
   • **Hotkey:** Ctrl + Alt + P (`^!p`)
     ⮞ Copies the currently selected text.
     ⮞ Saves it to a temporary file (`Clip2Print.txt`).
     ⮞ Opens Notepad in print mode to send the file to the default printer.
     ⮞ Cleans up the file after printing and restores the clipboard.

Key Features:
   • Displays a tooltip near the cursor: *“Printing selection... Please wait.”*
   • Uses `BlockInput, On` to prevent interference during copy and print.
   • Waits up to 2 seconds for clipboard content to become available.
   • Emits an error message if clipboard copy fails.
   • Preserves original clipboard content before and after operation.
   • Delays ensure printer command is properly dispatched before cleanup.

Use Case:
   • Quickly print text from any application without navigating menus.
   • Ideal for short notes, email snippets, or code blocks.
   • Lightweight and disposable — avoids leaving temporary files behind.

Technical Notes:
   • File is stored temporarily in the script’s own directory.
   • Uses `/P` switch in Notepad to silently print without opening a window.

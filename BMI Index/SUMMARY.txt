   • Drop-down menu allows selection between "Imperial" (default) and "Metric" systems.
   • For Imperial:
       ⮞ Input: Height in feet & inches, weight in pounds.
   • For Metric:
       ⮞ Input: Height in centimeters, weight in kilograms.

   • `ButtonCalculate`:
       ⮞ Converts inputs to meters/inches as needed.
       ⮞ Calculates BMI using:
           ⮚ Metric: `BMI = kg / (m²)`
           ⮚ Imperial: `BMI = (lbs * 703) / (in²)`
       ⮞ Determines weight status based on BMI thresholds.
   • `ButtonClear` resets all entry and result fields.
   • Closes gracefully via `GuiClose`.

Layout:
   • Top: Unit selector dropdown.

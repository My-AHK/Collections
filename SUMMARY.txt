
*  Custom colored GUI with colorized edit fields.

PURPOSE:
This script creates a compact, color-customized AutoHotkey GUI featuring editable fields for “Start Macro” and “Stop Macro” key inputs. 
Its design emphasizes visual clarity, focus control, and placeholder text styling for a refined user experience.

KEY FEATURES:
The GUI integrates both aesthetic and functional enhancements through Windows API calls and color management. 
The use of `WM_CTLCOLOREDIT` allows control over background and text color for each Edit box, achieving a cohesive theme.
   • Always-on-top GUI ensures visibility over other windows.  
   • Dynamic placeholder text (“****”) appears inside Edit controls.  
   • Custom color coordination with a blue background and yellow text.  
   • Focus removal prevents blinking caret distraction.  
   • Immediate GUI repaint enforces consistent visual initialization.  
   • Graceful closure through `GuiClose` safely terminates the app.  

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script begins by intercepting the `WM_CTLCOLOREDIT` message to manage color drawing for Edit controls. 
A solid blue brush is created via `CreateSolidBrush`, applied to both the GUI and Edit elements. 
During GUI creation, the Edit controls are given specific handles (`hwnd`) to permit targeted redraws and custom message calls. 
Placeholder text is set through `SendMessage` using the `EM_SETCUEBANNER` message (0x1501). 
Focus is programmatically cleared to enhance presentation, and repaint calls guarantee color uniformity immediately after the GUI is shown.
   • Registers `WM_CTLCOLOREDIT` message for color control.  
   • Defines static brush to avoid redundant handle creation.  
   • Uses DllCalls for background, text, and placeholder manipulation.  
   • Separates GUI display from setup with `Gui, Hide` to prevent flicker.  
   • Forces full refresh (`InvalidateRect`) to apply final visuals.  

LAYOUT:
The layout employs a concise and symmetrical two-row format. 
Each row features a descriptive label on the left and its corresponding input box aligned on the right. 
The overall window height is restricted to 100 pixels for minimal screen intrusion.
   • “Start Macro” label at coordinates (x30, y20) with Edit box at (x140, y18).  
   • “Stop Macro” label directly beneath, maintaining vertical spacing.  
   • Uniform Edit widths (60) ensure balanced alignment.  
   • Font set to bold 11pt with light cyan color (RGB 2e77ff).  
   • GUI color (0000FF) provides a cohesive blue background.  

USER EXPERIENCE:
The interface feels professional and modern due to color synchronization, focus handling, and clean geometry. 
By using DllCalls rather than higher-level commands, the GUI achieves instant and smooth rendering. 
The placeholders hint at functionality while maintaining a minimal, distraction-free design.
   • Bright text on blue offers strong readability.  
   • Hidden caret enhances aesthetic appeal.  
   • Consistent brush reuse avoids flickering.  
   • Close event terminates application immediately without residual artifacts.

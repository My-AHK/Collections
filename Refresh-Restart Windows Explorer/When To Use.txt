COMPARISON:
   • RestartExplorer.ahk
      - Completely terminates (taskkill /F /IM explorer.exe) and restarts (Run explorer.exe) Windows Explorer.
      - This is a brute-force approach that refreshes everything related to the Windows shell, including the taskbar, desktop, and File Explorer windows.

   • ReFreshExplorer.ahk
      - Uses COM (Shell.Application.Windows) to send a refresh command to all active Explorer windows, without terminating the process.
      - It avoids affecting other UI elements like the taskbar or desktop icons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros and Cons:
   • RestartExplorer.ahk
    ✅ Pros:
      - Resolves deeper issues such as a frozen taskbar, missing system tray icons, or an unresponsive desktop.
      - Clears memory leaks or glitches tied to Explorer.exe.

    ❌ Cons:
      - Can cause a momentary system disruption, closing all open Explorer windows and potentially affecting system tray applications.
      - May not be necessary for simple issues like refreshing File Explorer contents.
      - Any unsaved progress in Explorer-related tasks (file transfers, searches, etc.) will be lost.
-------------------------
   • ReFreshExplorer.ahk
       ✅ Pros:
      - A targeted refresh that only affects open File Explorer windows.
      - Does not disrupt the taskbar, desktop, or system tray applications.
      - Faster execution compared to fully restarting Explorer.

       ❌ Cons:
      - Won't fix deeper Windows Explorer issues, such as a frozen taskbar or missing system tray icons.
      - If an Explorer window is completely unresponsive, this script may fail to resolve the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION:
   • Use (RestartExplorer.ahk) if you are dealing with severe Explorer issues (e.g., missing taskbar, unresponsive desktop, system tray problems).
   • Use (ReFreshExplorer.ahk) if you just want to refresh File Explorer windows without affecting other parts of the system.

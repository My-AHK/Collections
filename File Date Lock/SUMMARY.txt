
*  File timestamp reverter - restores modified times.

Purpose:
   Restores modified timestamps of all files in the script's folder 
   (excluding the script itself) to their previously saved values. 
   Ensures file change dates are preserved during automation or testing.
   • Triggered via Ctrl+T hotkey.
   • Avoids altering its own file timestamp.
   • Protects against unintended file modification history.

Key Features:
   This script performs silent, structured timestamp restoration using 
   a persistent INI file as a source of truth.
   • Uses `filetimes.ini` to record and retrieve timestamps.
       ⮞ Automatically creates entries for new files.
       ⮞ Updates entries when timestamps are reverted.
   • Compares current file timestamps to saved records.
       ⮞ Detects if a file was modified since last save.
       ⮞ Only performs action if timestamps differ.
   • Shows a tooltip with a list of all reverted files.
       ⮞ Tooltip dynamically appears near mouse.
           ⮚ Allows contextual visibility.
           ⮚ Auto-hides after short duration.
   • Plays confirmation beep upon activation.
       ⮞ Beep helps confirm script successfully triggered.
           ⮚ Prevents confusion if nothing changes visually.

Logic Summary:
   The hotkey routine loops through files in the working directory and 
   conditionally restores timestamps based on INI data.
   • When Ctrl+T is pressed:
       ⮞ Plays a 200 ms beep at 1000 Hz.
       ⮞ Initializes `filetimes.ini` path.
   • File loop:
       ⮞ Iterates over all files in script directory.
           ⮚ Skips the script file itself.
       ⮞ For each file:
           ⮞ Attempts to read previous timestamp from INI.
               ⮚ If not found:
                   - Writes current timestamp to INI.
               ⮚ If found but differs from current:
                   - Restores timestamp using `FileSetTime`.
                   - Updates INI to reflect reverted value.
                   - Adds file name to report list.
   • Tooltip display:
       ⮞ Mouse position is retrieved.
       ⮞ Tooltip is offset slightly from cursor.
       ⮞ If any files were reverted:
           ⮞ Shows list of affected files.
           ⮞ Tooltip lasts 3000 ms.
       ⮞ If no changes:
           ⮞ Tooltip reports nothing needed.
           ⮞ Tooltip lasts 1500 ms.

Layout:
   Code is structured procedurally with minimal branching and compact 
   handling for clarity and ease of maintenance.
   • One hotkey handler: `^t::`
   • One cleanup label: `KillTip`
   • All functionality is inline — no external dependencies.
       ⮞ Uses built-in commands only (`Loop, Files`, `FileSetTime`, etc.)
       ⮞ Logic flows top-to-bottom with simple conditionals.

User Experience:
   Designed for instant-use without dialogs or prompts. Gives passive 
   feedback and completes its task automatically.
   • Beep sound ensures action feedback.
   • Tooltip gives real-time result.
       ⮞ Appears near the cursor.
       ⮞ Lists each affected file.
       ⮞ Hides after delay — no user action needed.
   • Non-disruptive — user workflow remains uninterrupted.
   • Prevents script from ever modifying its own timestamp.

* Full Summary:
Provides a GUI tool to strip comments from AHK scripts. Users can drag and drop files or folders containing .ahk files onto the GUI. The script processes these files by removing single-line and block comments, saving them with "NoComments" added to the file name. The GUI updates colors to indicate readiness, processing, and completion, and it handles transparency. The Strip function performs the actual comment removal. The GUI also supports window movement and exits when the escape key is pressed.

* Full Summary:
Provides a GUI tool for removing blank lines from .ahk files. The GUI includes a blue-themed always-on-top window with a drop area for files and folders, flanked by two AHK icons. Dropped files are processed: their contents are scanned for consecutive blank lines, which are removed, and the modified file is saved with "(Strip Blank Lines)" appended to its filename. The GUI color changes dynamically (blue for ready, green for processing, and purple upon completion) to reflect status. Dragging the window and exiting the application are supported via handlers.

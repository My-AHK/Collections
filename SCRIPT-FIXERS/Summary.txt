These three scripts collectively serve as a suite of tools to streamline the management, formatting, and cleanup of AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts. Each script addresses a specific aspect of script organization and editing:

Script 1: AHK Code Formatter and Debugger
Automates the organization of AutoHotkey scripts by managing indentation, function casing, and tracking function calls. It includes robust debugging tools for line counts and function management. The script also handles GUI storage in an INI file, manages file attributes, and enhances script editing efficiency with built-in tooltip and settings capabilities.

Script 2: Comment Stripper
Offers a GUI-based tool for removing comments from AHK files. Users can drag-and-drop files or folders onto the GUI, which processes them by stripping single-line and block comments. Files are saved with "NoComments" appended to their names. The GUI dynamically reflects status through color changes, and it is designed for ease of use with transparency, window dragging, and an escape key exit option.

Script 3: Blank Line Remover
Provides a user-friendly GUI for cleaning up AHK scripts by removing consecutive blank lines. Users can drag-and-drop files, and the processed files are saved with "(Strip Blank Lines)" appended to their names. The GUI features a dynamic blue theme with color changes to indicate readiness, processing, and completion. It also supports window movement and an escape key exit function.

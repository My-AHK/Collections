
* Monthly rent reminder with Edge launch and alert


PURPOSE:
This script provides a lightweight monthly reminder system that alerts the user on the first day of each month to pay rent. 
It performs an automatic date check, ensures the reminder runs only once per month, and presents both an audible cue and a visible on-screen notification while opening the payment portal in a web browser.

KEY FEATURES:
The script combines time-based automation, state tracking, browser launching, and a custom GUI alert to ensure the reminder is noticeable without being intrusive or repetitive.
   • Automatically checks the current day on startup and hourly thereafter.
   • Ensures the reminder triggers only once per calendar month.
   • Emits an audible beep to immediately grab attention.
   • Opens the rent payment website directly in Microsoft Edge.
   • Displays a custom always-on-top GUI reminder window.
       ⮞ Includes a draggable, borderless design.
       ⮞ Provides a clickable close button.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The logic centers around validating the calendar date and maintaining a simple monthly execution record. 
When conditions are met, the script performs all alert actions in a single pass.
   • Compares the current day against a fixed target date (the 1st).
   • Uses a stored year-month value to prevent duplicate execution.
   • Executes notification actions only when both conditions are satisfied.
       ⮞ Updates the stored month marker.
       ⮞ Triggers sound, browser launch, and GUI creation.
   • Continues running in the background for future checks.

LAYOUT:
The graphical layout is minimalistic and intentionally attention-grabbing, designed to remain visible without traditional window chrome.
   • Black background with high-contrast yellow and red text.
   • Large central message reading “Time To Pay Rent!!”.
   • Rounded window corners for a softer visual appearance.
   • Close button positioned just below and to the right of the main text.
   • Window positioned explicitly on screen for consistency.

USER EXPERIENCE:
From the user’s perspective, the script operates silently until needed, then provides a clear and unmistakable reminder with minimal interaction required.
   • No manual activation once running.
   • Immediate visual and audio feedback on the due date.
   • One-click access to the payment portal.
   • Simple dismissal via an on-screen close control.
   • Non-repeating behavior avoids alert fatigue.

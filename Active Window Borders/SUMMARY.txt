
*  Dynamic Window Border Visualization Suite.

PURPOSE:
These three scripts visually outline active windows by drawing animated, real-time tracking borders around them. 
Each version refines the concept, from a single-window toggle to a multi-window capable border tracker. 
The goal is to improve visual focus, assist multitasking, and enhance user awareness of active windows without permanently modifying them.
   • Script 1 emphasizes dynamic tracking and destruction-based cleanup.  
   • Script 2 focuses on simplicity and lightweight toggle responsiveness.  
   • Script 3 introduces multi-window support with intelligent hiding and reappearance.  

KEY FEATURES:
Each script uses (Ctrl + T) as the activation hotkey, dynamically generating GUIs with adjustable thickness and color to highlight windows.
   • Customizable border color and width using variables.  
   • Real-time tracking of window movement and resizing.  
   • Auto-cleanup when windows close or deactivate.  
   • Independent timer-driven refresh for smooth border motion.  
   • Cross-window adaptability between normal, minimized, or maximized states.  
       ⮞ Each border intelligently hides or destroys itself based on visibility conditions.  
   • Focus-based activation ensures only active or selected windows are outlined.  

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The logic progression across the three scripts demonstrates incremental sophistication. 
The design evolves from a simple toggle to a robust, multi-instance architecture capable of tracking multiple GUIs simultaneously.
   • Script 1:  
       ⮞ Uses a global flag `border_active` to toggle one border.  
       ⮞ Relies on `Gui, Destroy` to remove borders once inactive.  
       ⮞ Tracks the window handle via `WinGet` and redraws at 20 ms intervals.  
       ⮞ Applies a precise `WinSet, Region` to carve out the border edges.  
           ⮚ Ensures active window detection even during movement or focus shifts.  

   • Script 2:  
       ⮞ Simplifies activation logic using fewer variables.  
       ⮞ Toggles visibility with `Gui, Hide` instead of destruction.  
       ⮞ Reduces refresh rate to 50 ms for smoother performance.  
       ⮞ Utilizes only the currently active window (`A`) and disables if minimized.  
           ⮚ Prioritizes responsiveness over multi-window persistence.  

   • Script 3:  
       ⮞ Implements a dictionary (`activeWindows`) to track multiple active borders.  
       ⮞ Assigns a unique GUI ID per window via `guiCounter`.  
       ⮞ Employs conditional hiding rather than destruction to preserve states.  
       ⮞ Updates only active and normal (non-minimized/maximized) windows.  
           ⮚ Offers concurrent multi-border management while maintaining efficiency.  
           ⮚ Automatically cleans up expired handles when windows close.  

LAYOUT:
Each script is structured around a toggle hotkey block and a timed drawing routine. 
The visual border is rendered through GUI layering and region manipulation, ensuring accurate edge tracing of target windows.
   • Hotkey Block (`^t::`): Initiates or removes the border(s).  
   • Timer Routine (`DrawRect:`): Continuously recalculates window bounds.  
   • GUI Properties:  
       ⮞ `+AlwaysOnTop`, `-Caption`, `+E0x02000000`, and transparency flags ensure nonintrusive overlays.  
       ⮞ Borders update live with pixel-level precision.  
   • Region Drawing:  
       ⮞ Outer and inner coordinates form the hollow rectangular effect.  
       ⮞ Dynamic offsets maintain proportional border spacing.  
       ⮞ Conditional statements prevent drawing errors during resize or transition states.  

USER EXPERIENCE:
The visual result is a clean, glowing frame that subtly emphasizes focus without interfering with interaction. 
Each iteration enhances reliability, offering different usability priorities depending on task scope.
   • Script 1 delivers a balanced blend of control and stability, ideal for focused single-window workflows.  
       ⮞ Automatically removes inactive borders for resource conservation.  
   • Script 2 offers the simplest user experience, quick toggling with minimal overhead.  
       ⮞ Great for temporary highlights or debugging tasks.  
   • Script 3 provides the most advanced interaction, enabling simultaneous tracking of multiple windows.  
       ⮞ Best suited for multitasking environments or productivity overlays.  
       ⮞ Automatically adapts visibility based on window state and user focus.  

Through progressive refinement, this trio demonstrates evolving AHK GUI control mastery, from straightforward toggling to intelligent multi-instance synchronization, all delivering consistent, fluid visual emphasis on active windows.

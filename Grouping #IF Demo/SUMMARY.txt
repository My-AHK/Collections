
*  Demo: grouping #If statements with browsers.

PURPOSE:
This script serves as a demonstration of how to group multiple executables under one conditional directive using AutoHotkey’s `#IfWinActive` in combination with `GroupAdd`. 
It provides a clear example of how to manage context-sensitive hotkeys that only trigger within specific grouped applications.

KEY FEATURES:
The focus is on teaching and illustrating conditional grouping rather than on functionality itself.  
   • Demonstrates the creation of an application group named “browsers.”  
   • Shows how to apply `#IfWinActive` conditions to a defined group.  
   • Includes five example executables: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, and Opera.  
   • Demonstrates context-sensitive hotkeys limited to the active group.  
   • Ends with `#IfWinActive` reset to restore global scope and a closing Return.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script begins by using several `GroupAdd` commands to compile all listed browser executables into a single group identifier. 
The `#IfWinActive ahk_group browsers` directive follows, activating custom hotkeys only when a window from this group is active.  
   • `RButton & WheelUp` and `RButton & WheelDown` are used as sample actions.  
   • `Send ^{PgDn}` and `Send ^{PgUp}` simulate tab navigation for illustration.  
   • The logic highlights separation of grouped vs. global input conditions.

LAYOUT:
The script layout is simple and pedagogical, designed to make the grouping structure immediately clear. 
Each logical section is separated with visible dividers and annotated comments to reinforce its demonstration purpose.

USER EXPERIENCE:
For learners, the script provides a clear, functional reference for understanding `#IfWinActive` grouping.  
   • Offers hands-on insight into how grouped hotkeys behave.  
   • Encourages experimentation by replacing or adding executables.  
   • Serves as a reliable teaching and testing framework for AHK context control.

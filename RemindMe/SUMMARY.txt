
  *  Desktop reminder scheduler with cascading GUIs


PURPOSE:
This script implements a persistent desktop reminder system that allows users to schedule, store, and receive timed reminders through custom always-on-top GUIs. 
It is designed to provide precise date and time selection, visual feedback, and optional audible alerts, while remaining lightweight and fully self-contained without external dependencies.
   • Enables users to schedule reminders using a calendar-style interface.
   • Persists reminders across script reloads and system restarts.
   • Displays reminders in visually distinct, non-intrusive popup windows.

KEY FEATURES:
The script offers a comprehensive set of features centered around usability, validation, and persistence, ensuring reminders are reliable, flexible, and clearly communicated to the user at every stage.
   • Custom calendar GUI with month, day, year, hour, minute, and AM/PM selection.
   • Live display of the current date and time within the calendar window.
   • Optional chime playback when a reminder is triggered.
   • Robust input validation with dedicated error and warning dialogs.
   • Persistent reminder storage using a plain-text file.
   • Cascading and quadrant-based GUI positioning to prevent overlap.
   • Multiple GUI types for feedback:
       ⮞ Error dialogs for invalid input.
       ⮞ Warning dialogs for past-date confirmations.
       ⮞ Success dialogs confirming scheduled reminders.
       ⮞ Reminder popups when reminders are due.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The internal logic is organized around timed checks, structured reminder objects, and modular helper functions that handle validation, parsing, and GUI behavior. 
Reminders are represented as objects containing date, time, text, timestamp, and chime state, allowing consistent handling throughout the script.
   • A timer periodically checks for due reminders using system time comparisons.
   • Reminder timestamps are generated in sortable YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.
   • Date and time parsing supports flexible 12-hour input with AM/PM conversion.
   • Leap years and month-specific day limits are correctly calculated.
   • Past reminders trigger a confirmation workflow instead of silent rejection.
   • All reminder changes immediately update the persistent storage file.
   • On exit, reminders are automatically saved to prevent data loss.

LAYOUT:
The visual layout is carefully structured to balance clarity, compactness, and screen-awareness. 
All GUIs are border-based, captionless, and always-on-top, giving them a clean utility-style appearance.
   • Screen positioning is based on configurable screen quarters.
   • Cascading offsets are applied to prevent overlapping GUIs in the same region.
   • GUI dimensions dynamically adjust based on message length.
   • Color themes differentiate purpose and status:
       ⮞ Primary text, current time, messages, warnings, errors, and success states each use distinct colors.
   • Fonts are chosen per context to improve readability and emphasis.

USER EXPERIENCE:
From a user perspective, the script prioritizes clarity, feedback, and minimal friction when creating and receiving reminders. 
Every user action results in immediate visual confirmation or guidance, reducing ambiguity and preventing silent failures.
   • A double-tap Ctrl+R hotkey quickly opens the calendar interface.
   • Default selections are pre-filled with the current date and time.
   • Clear prompts guide users through scheduling a reminder.
   • Errors and warnings explain exactly what needs correction.
   • Success dialogs confirm scheduling with both current and future timestamps.
   • Reminder popups clearly show the message, scheduled time, and presentation time.
   • Optional audio cues reinforce time-sensitive notifications without being mandatory.

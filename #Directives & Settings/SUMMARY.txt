PURPOSE:
This guide defines the optimal performance settings and directive configurations for AutoHotkey v1.1 scripts across different usage profiles. 
It explains which directives improve speed, stability, or reliability and provides tailored combinations for gaming, GUI automation, text expansion, and background systems. 
Its goal is to help script authors maximize performance without sacrificing functionality or stability.

KEY FEATURES:
Each directive and setting is categorized by speed impact, from tiny to major, and grouped under clear performance contexts. 
The guide emphasizes conditional usage, showing when a directive is critical, recommended, conditional, or to be avoided, ensuring adaptability to different environments.
   • Profiles include Gaming, GUI-heavy, Text Processing, System Automation, Business, Pixel-based, and Server/Headless.
   • Each setting is labeled with its effect level and context, detailing whether it boosts responsiveness, stability, or CPU efficiency.
   • A final section lists the ideal execution order for applying directives to maximize performance consistency.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The document organizes directives into logical layers that affect initialization, concurrency, performance, and fine-tuning. 
Settings that control environment and activation behavior come first, followed by timing and input accelerators, then coordinate consistency, and finally debug and system optimizations.
   • Initialization layer: environment control (#NoEnv, #SingleInstance).
   • Performance layer: timing and Send/Mouse/Control speeds.
   • Stability and reliability layer: logging and priority management.
   • Conditional use ensures balance between raw speed and predictable execution.

LAYOUT:
The script follows a consistent structure using labeled sections, separators, and commentary explaining purpose and context. 
Each performance profile ends with a ready-to-use configuration example.
   • Sections include detailed commentary and indentation for readability.
   • Group headers and comments maintain visual and conceptual clarity.

USER EXPERIENCE:
Readers gain a practical, visual understanding of how to tune AutoHotkey directives efficiently. 
The multi-profile examples allow quick implementation for specific needs, ranging from ultra-fast gaming to stable background operation, without requiring advanced scripting knowledge.


*  Sort selected lines in editor via Ctrl+T GUI


PURPOSE:
This script provides a GUI-based utility for sorting selected multiline text within any text editor. 
Triggered by pressing Ctrl+T, it captures the currently active window and facilitates various sorting modes based on the character position specified by the user, without altering the clipboard contents permanently.

KEY FEATURES:
The tool integrates hotkey activation, GUI-based input, clipboard preservation, and flexible sorting configurations. 
It is ideal for processing blocks of text where line order matters, such as lists or structured data.
   • Hotkey activation using Ctrl+T
   • GUI interface with multiple sorting options
   • Sorting by character position (1–999)
   • Four sorting types: Normal, NormalDistinct, Reverse, ReverseDistinct
   • Preserves and restores clipboard automatically
   • Works within any text editor that supports copy/paste


------THE FOUR SORTING TYPES:----------------------
       ⮞ Normal 
           ⮚ This is a standard ascending sort starting at a specific character position on each line. All lines are included, even if they are duplicates.
           ⮚ Sort flags used: P<n>
              - P<n> means sort by character position <n> (e.g., P3 = sort starting at 3rd character)
           ⮚ Example: Sorting these lines with P3:
              - 1. Zebra
              - 2. Apple
              - 3. Banana
           ⮚ Looks at:
              - Line 1: "bra"
              - Line 2: "ple"
              - Line 3: "nana"
           ⮚ Result:
              - 2. Apple
              - 3. Banana
              - 1. Zebra
---------------------------------------------------------------
       ⮞ NormalDistinct 
           ⮚ Same as Normal, but removes duplicate lines during the sort. This is useful when you only want unique lines in your result.
           ⮚ Sort flags used: P<n> U
               - U = Unique- Removes duplicate lines (Still sorts ascending from the specified position)
           ⮚ Example:
              - Item: Apple
              - Item: Banana
              - Item: Apple
           ⮚ Result:  Sorted by P7 (start from 'A')
              - Item: Apple
              - Item: Banana
---------------------------------------------------------------
       ⮞ Reverse 
           ⮚ This is a descending sort, including duplicate lines. Sorting starts at the specified character position and reverses the order.
           ⮚ Sort flags used: P<n> R
              - R = Reverse- sorts descending (Keeps duplicates)
           ⮚ Example:
              - X-ray
              - Delta
              - Charlie
           ⮚ Result:  Sorting from character 1 in reverse (because X > D > C)
              - X-ray
              - Delta
              - Charlie
---------------------------------------------------------------
       ⮞ ReverseDistinct
           ⮚ Performs a descending sort from the specified character position and removes duplicate lines.
           ⮚ Sort flags used: P<n> R U
              - R = Reverse
              - U = Unique
           ⮚ Example:
              - Zebra
              - Banana
              - Apple
              - Zebra
           ⮚ Result:  Sorting from position 1
              - Zebra
              - Banana
              - Apple
---------------------------------------------------------------


LOGIC SUMMARY:
When activated, the script captures the active window, then displays a GUI allowing users to choose a sorting method and define the starting character position. 
Upon selection, it reactivates the original window, copies the selected text, checks for multiple lines, sorts it according to user input, and pastes it back. 
Clipboard contents are restored afterward to avoid data loss.
   • Saves the active window ID on launch
   • Opens a GUI prompting sort type and character position
   • Reactivates the original window before processing
   • Copies text via Ctrl+C and checks for valid multiline data
   • Sorts using AHK's built-in `Sort` command with flags
   • Pastes the sorted content and restores the clipboard

LAYOUT:
The layout is compact, focused on usability and minimal intrusion. 
It uses an always-on-top GUI containing instructional text, four sorting buttons, and a numeric input field.
   • GUI dimensions: W390 x H75 (centered)
   • Instruction text appears at the top
   • Sorting buttons aligned horizontally:
       ⮞ Normal
       ⮞ NormalDistinct
       ⮞ Reverse
       ⮞ ReverseDistinct
   • Numeric input field (default = 1) for character position
   • GUI destroys itself after action or cancel

USER EXPERIENCE:
The script is designed for ease-of-use, requiring no manual clipboard manipulation or setup. 
Users simply select text in a compatible editor, press Ctrl+T, and choose their sorting preference. 
Clear messaging ensures users understand requirements (multiline text must be selected), and fallback behaviors prevent crashes or unintended results.
   • Non-destructive to clipboard
   • Minimal input required: press Ctrl+T, click a button
   • Informative MsgBox warnings if selection is invalid
   • Automatically validates input and defaults to position 1 if needed
   • GUI cancels or exits cleanly via 'Cancel' or close box


*  Mouse Acceleration Toggle — Control, View, and Restore Settings.

Purpose:
   This script allows users to view, enable, disable, or toggle Windows mouse acceleration directly via hotkeys.
   It also preserves the original system settings and restores them upon exit for safety.
   • Designed for gamers, power users, and testers.
   • Useful for temporarily adjusting mouse behavior with one keypress.

Key Features:
   • On startup:
       ⮞ Saves current mouse acceleration settings (acceleration flag, min/max thresholds).
       ⮞ Registers an exit handler to restore them automatically.
   • Hotkey Controls:
       ⮞ `Ctrl + NumpadAdd` → Enable mouse acceleration.
       ⮞ `Ctrl + NumpadSub` → Disable mouse acceleration.
       ⮞ `Ctrl + NumpadEnter` → Toggle mouse acceleration on/off.
   • Each action triggers a dialog displaying:
       ⮞ Acceleration state (0 = Off, 1 = On).
       ⮞ Minimum and maximum thresholds.
       ⮞ Human-readable explanation of how thresholds affect behavior.

Mouse Settings Explained:
   • Acceleration: Boolean (0 or 1).
   • Min Threshold:
       ⮞ Speed below this = no acceleration.
   • Max Threshold:
       ⮞ Speed above this = max acceleration applied.
   • Between min & max = gradual acceleration increase.

System Integration:
   • Uses `SystemParametersInfo` via `DllCall` to read and write values.
   • Flags:
       ⮞ `SPI_GETMOUSE` (3) — reads accel/min/max settings.
       ⮞ `SPI_SETMOUSE` (4) — writes new settings.
       ⮞ Optionally updates user profile (with `fWinIni = 1`).

Data Flow:
   • `SaveOriginalSettings()` called immediately on load.
   • `RestoreOriginalSettings()` auto-runs on script exit.
   • Values are stored in globals:
       ⮞ `OriginalAccel`, `OriginalMin`, `OriginalMax`.

Function Summary:
   • `SPI_GETMOUSE(ByRef accel, ByRef min?, ByRef max?)`
       ⮞ Outputs 3 system parameters.
   • `SPI_SETMOUSE(accel, min?, max?, fWinIni := 0)`
       ⮞ Writes new values (default fallback: 6 min, 10 max if accel=1).

Design Notes:
   • No GUI – minimalistic, fast, and hotkey-only.
   • Defensive programming:
       ⮞ Fallback defaults for thresholds if not explicitly provided.
       ⮞ Profile-safe – changes revert when script exits.

Ideal Use:
   • Perfect for users wanting to temporarily disable acceleration for FPS gaming,
     then restore it afterward — all without needing to open system settings.

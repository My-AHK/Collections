
*  Image viewer overlay with arrow key control.



PURPOSE:
This script provides an image viewer overlay that displays and cycles through images from the script's folder. It allows the user to invoke the GUI with Ctrl+T and navigate images using the left and right arrow keys when the overlay is active.

KEY FEATURES:
It automatically scans for PNG, JPG, and GIF files in the script's folder and presents them in a centered, semi-transparent GUI. The interface stays always on top and supports keyboard navigation for browsing through the image set.
   • Trigger GUI with Ctrl+T hotkey.
   • Loads .png, .jpg, and .gif from the current directory.
   • Supports left/right key cycling through images.
   • Semi-transparent and always-on-top GUI.
   • Image displayed centered and scaled to 400×400.
   • Tooltip shows the current image path.
   • Auto-hides the tooltip after 1.5 seconds.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
When the hotkey is pressed, it checks whether the GUI was already created. If not, it initializes GUI size/position variables and populates an image list. Upon showing the GUI, it calls `LoadImage()` with the current index. Navigation is handled with arrow keys, updating the index and reloading the corresponding image.
   • GUI creation only occurs once.
   • `imageList` is populated via file loops.
   • `LoadImage(num)` displays the selected image.
   • Tooltip reflects the image path for user reference.
   • If image path is invalid, the script shows a message and closes the GUI.

LAYOUT:
The GUI uses a solid teal background with transparency applied to blend seamlessly over desktop content. The image is displayed within a `Picture` control, scaled to 400×400 pixels, and centered based on the GUI dimensions.
   • GUI dimensions: 450×450 at position (1400, 500).
   • Image centered via calculated offset.
   • Transparent background achieved with `WinSet, TransColor`.

USER EXPERIENCE:
The script offers a lightweight, keyboard-friendly image browser with an unobtrusive overlay interface. Tooltips provide immediate feedback about the file shown, and the transparent GUI ensures minimal disruption to the user’s workspace.
   • Quick access via hotkey.
   • Visual feedback through tooltips.
   • Smooth browsing using arrow keys.
   • Auto-centering ensures visual consistency.
   • Closes on image load failure, preventing dangling windows.

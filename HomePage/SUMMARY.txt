
PURPOSE:
Implements a fully interactive TreeView-based bookmark and link manager using AutoHotkey. Its primary purpose is to allow users to create, organize, edit, search, and persistently store categorized links in a hierarchical structure, functioning as a localized homepage or personal bookmark database.
   • Provides a desktop-based alternative to browser bookmark managers.
   • Supports hierarchical organization through root categories and child links.
   • Persists all data locally for reuse across sessions.

KEY FEATURES:
The script delivers complete CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality for bookmarks while integrating menu commands, hotkeys, and GUI controls to streamline link management. It emphasizes usability, persistence, and structural integrity of the stored data.
   • TreeView-driven category and link organization.
       ⮞ Root categories and nested child links.
       ⮞ Automatic selection and expansion behaviors.
   • Full CRUD operations.
       ⮞ Add, edit, delete, and search links.
       ⮞ Confirmation prompts for destructive actions.
   • Persistent storage system.
       ⮞ Saves all tree data to a structured text file.
       ⮞ Reloads and reconstructs hierarchy on startup.
   • Menu bar and hotkey integration.
       ⮞ Menu-based access to all major actions.
       ⮞ Keyboard shortcuts for power users.
   • Status bar feedback.
       ⮞ Real-time messages for user actions and results.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The script maintains an internal object-based data model synchronized with a TreeView control. Each TreeView item maps to an entry in the TreeData object, allowing GUI interactions to remain consistent with stored data. Changes are immediately reflected both visually and in persistent storage.
   • TreeData object acts as the authoritative data source.
       ⮞ Stores text, URL, description, and parent ID.
   • Menu handlers drive user actions.
       ⮞ Add, edit, delete, search, expand, and collapse logic.
   • Two-pass load algorithm ensures hierarchy integrity.
       ⮞ First pass creates root nodes.
       ⮞ Second pass rebuilds child relationships using ID mapping.
   • Safeguards prevent invalid operations.
       ⮞ Selection checks before edits or deletions.
       ⮞ Loop attempt limits avoid infinite rebuild cycles.

LAYOUT:
The GUI is divided into a left-side TreeView for navigation and a right-side detail panel for editing link properties. Dynamic resizing logic ensures usability across varying window sizes without breaking layout consistency.
   • Left panel.
       ⮞ TreeView displaying categories and links.
   • Right panel.
       ⮞ Editable fields for title, URL, and description.
       ⮞ Action buttons and quick-access link controls.
   • Responsive resizing handler.
       ⮞ Adjusts control sizes and positions on window resize.
       ⮞ Maintains margins and proportional spacing.

USER EXPERIENCE:
The user experience is designed to be efficient, informative, and forgiving. Immediate visual feedback, keyboard shortcuts, and automatic field population reduce friction, while confirmation dialogs and status messages help prevent accidental data loss.
   • Immediate feedback for all actions.
       ⮞ Status bar updates confirm results.
   • Reduced manual effort.
       ⮞ Auto-population of edit fields on selection.
       ⮞ Auto-selection of newly created items.
   • Keyboard-centric workflow.
       ⮞ Hotkeys for common operations like add, save, delete, and search.
   • Safe interaction model.
       ⮞ Confirmation prompts before deletions.
       ⮞ Graceful handling of missing or empty data files.

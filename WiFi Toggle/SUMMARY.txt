
*  Three WiFi toggles with distinct GUI styles


PURPOSE:
These three AutoHotkey scripts provide a fast, keyboard-driven way to check internet connectivity and toggle WiFi on or off, while giving immediate visual and audible feedback. 
Each script shares identical core networking logic and hotkeys, differing only in how the on-screen status notification is styled and rendered.
   • Enable instant WiFi disconnect and reconnect without opening Windows settings.
   • Provide clear confirmation of connection state and internet reachability.
   • Offer multiple visual presentation styles to suit different aesthetic preferences.

KEY FEATURES:
All three scripts include a robust, administrator-aware WiFi control system that safely manages connections and reports status. 
They rely on Windows-native tools and avoid external dependencies while still offering reliability and redundancy.
   • Hotkeys for status check and toggle actions.
       ⮞ Ctrl + T checks current internet connectivity.
       ⮞ Ctrl + Shift + T disconnects or reconnects WiFi.
   • Automatic elevation to administrator privileges when required.
   • Multi-stage reconnection logic with fallback strategies.
   • Audible feedback paired with color-coded visual notifications.
   • Internet validation using multiple HTTP endpoints for accuracy.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
The internal logic is identical across all three scripts and is designed for reliability rather than speed alone. 
Each toggle action begins by determining whether the system is currently connected to a WiFi network, then branches accordingly.
   • If connected:
       ⮞ The current SSID is stored.
       ⮞ WiFi is disconnected using netsh.
       ⮞ A red status notification confirms disconnection.
   • If not connected:
       ⮞ The script attempts reconnection in stages.
           ⮚ Reconnect to the last known SSID.
           ⮚ Scan saved WiFi profiles and connect to an available one.
           ⮚ Disable and re-enable the WiFi adapter as a last resort.
       ⮞ Connectivity is verified both at the network and internet level.
   • Internet reachability is confirmed using multiple HTTP test endpoints.
   • Temporary command output files are created, parsed, and cleaned up automatically.

LAYOUT:
The primary distinction between the three scripts lies in how the status GUI is drawn and styled. 
Each version uses the same size, font, and positioning, but applies a different edge treatment.
   • Border Edge version:
       ⮞ Uses a simple bordered, rectangular GUI window.
       ⮞ Clean and minimal with a classic utility look.
   • Rounded Corners version:
       ⮞ Applies a rounded region to the GUI window.
       ⮞ Produces a softer, modern appearance.
   • Trimmed Edge version:
       ⮞ Draws a custom inner trim using region masking.
       ⮞ Allows precise control over trim thickness and color.
       ⮞ Most visually refined and configurable of the three.

USER EXPERIENCE:
From a user’s perspective, all three scripts behave identically in operation and responsiveness. 
The choice between them is purely aesthetic, allowing the user to select the visual style that best fits their desktop environment or personal taste.
   • Instant visual confirmation reduces uncertainty during network changes.
   • Color-coded messages clearly distinguish success, failure, and warnings.
   • Audible cues reinforce actions without requiring visual focus.
   • Minimal screen footprint avoids disruption during normal workflow.
   • Consistent hotkeys ensure muscle-memory-friendly operation across all versions.

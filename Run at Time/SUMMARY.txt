
*  Scheduled Webpage Launcher at Set Time.

PURPOSE:
   This script checks the system clock once per second and launches a predefined URL at a specific time of day. 
   It is ideal for automating tasks that must occur at a fixed daily time, such as opening a reference site or triggering a web service without manual input.
   • Launches a webpage at 5:15 AM by default.
       ⮞ Uses 24-hour format to define target time.
       ⮞ Can be modified to run any desired command.
   • Ensures the action triggers only once per minute.
       ⮞ Prevents repeated triggers during the same minute.
       ⮞ Resets itself on the next minute for the next day.

KEY FEATURES:
   The script uses `SetTimer` to repeatedly check the time every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). 
   When the system clock matches the configured hour and minute, it executes the specified action only once within that minute. 
   A boolean flag ensures the action doesn't retrigger until the time condition resets.
   • Target time is set using `TargetHour` and `TargetMin`.
   • Action is a configurable string passed to `Run`.
   • `hasRunThisMinute` avoids duplicate executions per minute.

LOGIC SUMMARY:
   The timer calls the `TimeCheck` label once per second.
   If the current hour and minute match the target values, and the action hasn’t already run in that minute, the script executes the specified command. 
   Once run, it sets a flag to prevent repeats. 
   When the time no longer matches, the flag resets, preparing the script for the next day’s run.
   • One-second timer ensures prompt activation.
   • Simple flag prevents accidental repeats.
   • No GUI or user interaction needed.

LAYOUT:
   The script contains only global variable declarations, a timer definition, and a single label (`TimeCheck:`).
   It operates silently in the background with minimal overhead, using only standard AHK commands.
   • Variables define schedule and action.
   • Logic runs within a single label triggered by timer.
   • No GUI, tray menu, or message boxes are used.

USER EXPERIENCE:
   Users can schedule an automatic launch of any application or URL with minimal setup. 
   Once running, the script requires no interaction and consumes negligible system resources.
   It provides a reliable method for time-based automation and can be easily repurposed by adjusting the target time or action.
   • No input required once configured.
   • Can be used to automate daily reference sites or reminders.
   • Prevents multiple launches in the same time window.
   • Easily customizable for different time-based triggers.

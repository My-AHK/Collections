SECTION HEADERS & PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE
Each summary consists of clearly labeled section headers, followed by a descriptive paragraph, then supporting bullet-points (if applicable).

Sections (and Order):
   PURPOSE:
   KEY FEATURES:
   LOGIC SUMMARY:
   LAYOUT:
   USER EXPERIENCE:

1. Each section starts with a capitalized header followed by a colon (:).
2. The first item under each header is a paragraph (never a list).
3. Paragraphs use full sentences, complete thoughts, and clarify function and behavior before bullets are used.

BULLET STYLE
Supporting bullet-points are allowed only after the introductory paragraph in any section. 
These follow strict rules:

Bullet Level Definitions:
    First Level (1st) 
    Symbol: •  
    Indentation: 3 spaces  
        Second Level (2nd)
        Symbol: ⮞  
        Indentation: 7 spaces
            Third Level (3rd)
            Symbol: ⮚  
            Indentation: 11 spaces  
                Fourth Level (4th)
                Symbol: -  
                Indentation: 15 spaces 
                    Fifth Level (5th)
                    Symbol: ∙  
                    Indentation: 19 spaces

Example:  
   • This is a first-level bullet. (3 spaces)
       ⮞ This is a second-level bullet. (7 spaces)
           ⮚ This is a third-level bullet. (11 spaces)
               - This is a fourth-level bullet. (15 spaces)
                   ∙ This is a fifth-level bullet. (19 spaces)

Additional Notes:
   • No bullet symbols may be substituted.
   • No missing or extra spaces before bullets.
   • If a bullet-point section exists, it always follows a paragraph.
   • Nested bullets can be used within any section, as deep as level 5.

DELIVERY FORMAT
1.  All summaries are enclosed in a code block using triple backticks (```) for .txt compatibility.
2. A single-line tag...


*  Resizable always-on-top GUI with tiled BMP background.


PURPOSE:  
This script creates a resizable GUI window that stays always on top and displays two overlapping transparent images. It customizes the dialog box background by applying a tiled bitmap pattern to give the GUI a unique visual style.

KEY FEATURES:  
The GUI window supports resizing and includes the standard maximize button.  
It remains always on top of other windows for persistent visibility.  
Two picture controls display PNG images with transparent backgrounds, layered closely together.  
A custom message handler intercepts the WM_CTLCOLORDLG message to paint the dialogâ€™s background using a tiled bitmap brush loaded from an external BMP file.

LOGIC SUMMARY:  
The script sets GUI margins and font, then adds two transparent pictures positioned near the top-left corner.  
It registers a handler for the Windows message WM_CTLCOLORDLG (0x136), which is sent before the dialog is drawn.  
This handler creates a pattern brush from "B-ground.bmp" on the first call and caches it for reuse.  
Returning the brush handle instructs Windows to use the bitmap pattern as the dialog background.  
The GUI is displayed with a specific title, then the script sleeps briefly before awaiting user input.  
Closing the GUI or pressing Escape cleanly exits the application.

LAYOUT:  
The GUI has 15-pixel margins and uses a bold Arial Black font at size 12 (though no text controls are added).  
Two picture controls are added with precise coordinates to overlay two PNG images with transparent backgrounds.  
The background uses a tiled bitmap pattern loaded from a BMP file in the script directory.  
The window is resizable and always on top.

USER EXPERIENCE:  
Users see a small, visually distinct window with a tiled background pattern and two layered transparent images near the top-left.  
The window can be resized and remains visible over other windows.  
Exiting the window or pressing Escape closes the script immediately without errors or delays.


*  MATHS toolkit - sum, prime, factors, and compare.

Purpose:
   The “MATHS” folder contains a cohesive set of four AutoHotkey GUI tools for performing core number operations: 
   • summation and averages
   • prime checking
   • factor analysis
   • and common factor comparison. 
   These scripts assist in both basic arithmetic evaluation and deeper mathematical inspection.
   • Designed for precision, speed, and visual clarity.
   • Offers clipboard integration and drag-free interaction.
   • Ideal for students, analysts, programmers, and technical users.

Key Features:
   Each script provides its own specialty while maintaining consistent 
   usability, interface logic, and feedback systems.
   • Script 1 – **Count, Sum, & Average**:
       ⮞ Activated via Ctrl+Alt+T or tray menu.
       ⮞ Copies selected text (numbers), extracts values, sums, and averages.
           ⮚ Skips currency symbols and comma formatting.
           ⮚ Automatically counts valid entries.
       ⮞ Displays results in a timed MsgBox:
           ⮚ Record count, formatted sum, and average.
       ⮞ Clipboard is preserved and restored after operation.
       ⮞ No GUI — works on selections from other windows.

   • Script 2 – **LCM & GCF Calculator**:
       ⮞ Simple GUI with two number fields.
       ⮞ Calculates:
           ⮞ Least Common Multiple (LCM).
           ⮞ Greatest Common Factor (GCF).
       ⮞ Results are copied to clipboard automatically.
       ⮞ Uses internal math routines — no dependency on math libraries.

   • Script 3 – **Prime Number Tester**:
       ⮞ GUI input for single number analysis.
       ⮞ Loops through all possible factors up to number ÷ 2.
       ⮞ Shows real-time progress and allows Esc key to abort early.
       ⮞ Displays result in popup GUI:
           ⮞ Lists all factors or declares the number as prime.
       ⮞ Clipboard copy supported via result GUI.

   • Script 4 – **Multi-Number GCD & Shared Factors**:
       ⮞ Accepts 2 or more comma/space-separated numbers.
       ⮞ Automatically normalizes and cleans input.
       ⮞ Finds all shared divisors:
           ⮞ Loops up to the smallest value.
           ⮞ Verifies full divisibility across all entries.
       ⮞ Displays shared factor list and GCD in a styled result window.
       ⮞ Result can be copied with one button.
       ⮞ GUI includes Hide and Exit controls.
       ⮞ Supports Ctrl+T hotkey to reopen GUI.

Logic Summary:
   While each script operates independently, they share consistent 
   handling and feedback logic to offer intuitive interactions.
   • Inputs are captured via GUI or clipboard.
   • Math operations are calculated using native AHK functions and loops.
   • User feedback is presented in MsgBoxes or result GUIs.
   • Clipboard integration exists where appropriate.
   • Result formatting ensures clarity and professional alignment.
   • Some scripts allow aborting or re-triggering via hotkeys.

Layout:
   GUIs are compact, minimal, and purpose-focused.
   • Common traits:
       ⮞ `+AlwaysOnTop` for easy reference.
       ⮞ Font styling for visual grouping.
       ⮞ Button labels are straightforward (OK, Copy, Exit).
       ⮞ Spacing and sizing tuned for single-window use.
   • Script-specific differences:
       ⮞ Prime/GCD scripts use dual-GUI windows for results.
       ⮞ Sum/Average script is headless and hotkey-driven.
       ⮞ Color themes differ but retain readability.

User Experience:
   The “MATHS” suite enables quick number-driven decisions without 
   relying on external tools or calculators.
   • Users can:
       ⮞ Analyze selections from external windows (Script 1).
       ⮞ Compare multiple values or test primehood (Scripts 3 & 4).
       ⮞ Evaluate LCM/GCF pairs with clipboard-ready outputs (Script 2).
   • Results are:
       ⮞ Pasted-ready.
       ⮞ Clearly formatted.
       ⮞ Non-intrusive (time-limited or closable).
   • Ideal for quick math without spreadsheet overhead.

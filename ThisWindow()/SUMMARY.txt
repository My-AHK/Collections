
*  23+ window info popups + full report via ^T


PURPOSE:
This script provides a powerful set of window inspection tools accessible via the Ctrl+T hotkey. 
Upon activation, it gathers and displays a wide range of information about the currently active window, such as dimensions, position, title, process details, and visual states like transparency or "always on top" status. 
It’s useful for developers, script authors, or power users who need real-time insight into window properties.

KEY FEATURES:
The script showcases 23 individual examples of window property retrieval using a unified helper function. 
It combines AutoHotkey’s built-in window commands with DLL calls for advanced attributes. 
All displayed information is copied to the clipboard and shown in timed message boxes, with a final consolidated report combining all details.
   • Accesses and displays 23 different window-related properties
   • Uses `ThisWindow()` function to abstract WinGet calls
   • Consolidated window info report at the end
   • Timed message boxes display each property briefly
   • Information also copied to clipboard for external use
   • Includes transparency level and "always on top" status via DLL

LOGIC SUMMARY:
When Ctrl+T is pressed, the script emits a beep, then performs 23 successive checks on the currently active window using the custom `ThisWindow()` function. 
Each check assigns a descriptive string to the clipboard and shows it in a message box. 
After all examples, the script compiles a formatted report containing all attributes. 
Advanced info like window transparency and "always on top" status are retrieved using DLL calls in the helper function `GetWindowTransparency()`.
   • SoundBeep signals activation
   • Each property is queried using a single reusable function
   • Clipboard is updated with human-readable summaries
   • MsgBox displays info for 3 seconds per example
   • Final report includes multiple formatted sections:
       ⮞ Geometry
       ⮞ Status
       ⮞ Metadata
   • Transparency and Z-order are queried using Win32 APIs

LAYOUT:
The script is organized into clear sections: 23 labeled example blocks, followed by a consolidated data section and two reusable function definitions at the bottom. 
Each example is self-contained and includes a clipboard update and brief on-screen display. 
The final report groups values under labeled headers for clarity.
   • 23 examples formatted consistently with section markers
   • Final multi-line report uses visual separators and alignment
   • Functions placed at the end for modular design
   • Helper function maps string keys like “X” or “PID” to proper window queries

USER EXPERIENCE:
Users trigger the utility with Ctrl+T while any window is active. 
Each piece of information is shown quickly and unobtrusively. 
The final comprehensive window report remains on screen for 20 seconds, giving the user ample time to review or copy it. 
Clipboard updates ensure that data can be reused immediately in other contexts (e.g., debugging, automation). 
The design requires no setup or GUI interaction, making it fast and convenient.
   • Zero setup required — just press Ctrl+T
   • Each popup auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
   • Final report stays visible for 20 seconds
   • Report copied to clipboard for later use
   • Works with any currently active window

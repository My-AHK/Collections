
*  Countdown Until event with real-time display


PURPOSE:  
This script displays a real-time countdown to a user-defined target date and time using a clean, frameless GUI titled "Countdown Until." It provides an accurate and engaging visual reference for time remaining until a significant event or deadline.

   • Intended for marking time until a specific future moment.
   • User defines the target date and time in one place.
   • Offers live feedback and a final alert when time expires.

KEY FEATURES:  
The script is designed to be lightweight, precise, and visually straightforward, offering both numeric and descriptive countdown formats.

   • Fully configurable target date and time.
   • Updates every 500 milliseconds for responsiveness.
   • GUI remains always on top and has no system caption or title bar.
   • Countdown shown in red with formatted time (HH:MM:SS and days).
   • Target date shown in static blue text below countdown.
   • Dynamic status text summarizes remaining time.
   • Alert and message shown when countdown completes.
   • Includes hotkeys: Esc to quit, F5 to refresh timer.

LOGIC SUMMARY:  
At its core, the script constructs a target datetime string and compares it with the current system time, calculating the difference in seconds to generate countdown values.

   • Creates `TargetTime` in the format yyyyMMddHHmmss.
   • Retrieves current time via `FormatTime`, then subtracts it.
   • Calculates remaining:
       ⮞ Days
       ⮞ Hours
       ⮞ Minutes
       ⮞ Seconds
   • Countdown string built with optional days and zero-padded digits.
   • Display is updated using `GuiControl` for seamless refresh.
   • If countdown reaches zero or below:
       ⮞ A bold message is shown.
       ⮞ System alert sound is played.
       ⮞ Timer is halted to stop further updates.

LAYOUT:  
The graphical interface is compact and centered, with color-coded text elements and consistent layout spacing. Text is clearly segmented for readability.

   • Window titled “Countdown Until” and sized to 300px wide.
   • Countdown appears at the top in red, using Segoe UI font.
   • Target time is shown in blue below the countdown.
   • Remaining time summary appears at the bottom in red.

USER EXPERIENCE:  
When launched, the script instantly displays a placeholder, which is quickly replaced by the live countdown. Interaction is minimal by design, ensuring clarity and focus.

   • Intuitive and minimal interface requires no input.
   • Displays a dramatic message when time expires.
   • Optional sound serves as an audible alert.
   • Escape key closes the script immediately.
